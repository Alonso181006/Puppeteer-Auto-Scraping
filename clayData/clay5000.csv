,"Garden Maker","✅ Garden Maker","Garden Maker","Natural and organic fertilizers with complete ingredient transparency, custom-mixed for your garden’s unique needs.

At Garden Maker Naturals, we believe you have the fundamental right to know, and control, every ingredient you are feeding your plants and your soil. After all, you can’t truly know what you grow until you know what’s in your fertilizer. We operate our company and build our products with three core values: Total Transparency, Complete Control and Natural Nutrition.

Total Transparency

We call our formulation philosophy Full Plantsparency. We show you the exact formulas for all our Signature Blends; every ingredient, every proportion. Sure, someone else could come along and copy our formula, but so what? For us, it’s not about offering product formulas that no one else has, it’s about offering a level of transparency that no one else provides.

To us, transparency also means minimal messing around with Mother Nature, and making sure every fertilizer ingredient delivers real, garden-growing benefits. In our Signature Blends, every single ingredient serves a nutrient-boosting or microbe-feeding purpose. And our Custom Mixes allow you to eliminate any ingredients your garden might not need.

Complete Control
We know there’s a lot about gardening we can’t control (the weather comes to mind). So it’s important to us to help you control the things you can, like the composition of your fertilizer. Our Mix Customizer lets you choose from a long list of individual ingredients in any combination or proportion, so your fertilizer is 100% tailored to your garden’s unique needs.

We also want to make it easier for you to garden according to your own principles. If you are following strict OMRI guidelines to grow or sell your produce organically, rest assured that every ingredient labeled “Organic” on our site has been approved by OMRI and/or CDFA. Our Vegan products do not contain any animal products, and non-GMO ingredients.","Chemical Manufacturing","51-200 employees","Privately Held","Elwood, Kansas","United States","gardenmaker.com","https://www.linkedin.com/company/gardenmaker",,,,,

,"Attic Pablo Insulation Services","✅ Attic Pablo Insulation Services","Attic Pablo Insulation Services","What happens if you have poor insulation?
Attic insulation prevents the outside temperature from entering your house and keeping the inside temperature constant. This waves off the load on your heating device, and they do not have to work vigorously. However, if this insulation is ripped or damaged, you might notice that your energy bills are suddenly going up.
Insulation Companies in Oakland, CA, use two types of attic materials:
• Fiberglass
• Cellulose
