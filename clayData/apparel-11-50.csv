,"Norma Kamali Inc.","Norma Kamali began her business in 1967 as a shop owner making styles in her sample room, and selling from her retail store.

Her goal from that first day as an entrepreneur up until today was to have the freedom to be creative, and to use that creativity to design styles for women to make them feel good.

Norma Kamali is not just a designer. She is an innovator. An inventor. The sleeping bag coat, the high-heeled sneaker and the parachute collection are all iconic Kamali looks. In 1980, she was the first to present the innovative sweats and active sportswear collection as core parts of her brand, where they remain today. Her influential swimwear is recognized globally as highly directional and has remained an influence in the market for decades. The KamaliKulture collection of affordable styles are all easy care, require no dry cleaning and are great for travel and the modern lifestyle.

Norma is the 2016 recipient of CFDA's Geoffrey Beene Lifetime Achievement Award. She has won numerous awards for fashion, film, interior design, and architecture. She has also received honors from the White House for her work with public schools, and a wide assortment of pro-education organizations.  

The Wellness Café, the products in the cafe, as well as the information and guidance Norma provides her followers is another aspect of her connection to women. By informing women on topics that relate to self-esteem, and body image, she feels their confidence can develop. A healthy body translates to a healthy mind and spirit. This is an empowered woman.

Her Stop Objectification campaign focuses on the unique experiences a woman has regarding objectification - issues that affect women worldwide. Her goal is to rid women of the stigma left behind by those experiences.

,"Pair of Thieves","It used to be that if you were looking for affordable basics that offered performance and style, all you’d find was disappointment. Every sock on the market was a compromise. If you wanted fun patterned socks with cushioned support, you’d need to throw your dress socks over your sport socks. Rhetorically…who double bags their feet? We started Pair of Thieves to fix all that by creating basics that didn’t compromise on any of those fronts.

Our solution is to make our product and our customer Ready for Everything. We create basics so versatile, by comparison, a swiss army knife is a paper weight. On any given day you might go from work to workout, to night out, to lights out. We make sure our basics comfort and perform at every stop on that tour.

We’ve been fortunate to partner with charities and contribute in a big way to several causes. From helping people struggling with homelessness, to mental health outreach, to crisis intervention for LGBTQ+ youth. With the support of our customers, we have been able to help important organizations addressing these critical needs. 

We created The Pair of Thieves Good Fits Collection to provide great products that help amazing causes. We’re proud to donate money, product, and time in association with each of the causes tied to the Good Fits collection. To date we have…

• Donated over 3 million pairs of socks and other everyday essentials to charities addressing homelessness.
• Donated 50% of all Pride Collection proceeds to The Trevor Project for LQBTQ+ youth crisis intervention. Proud to donate $100,000 in 2022.
• Donated $2 from the sale of every pair of Never Alone socks to The American Foundation for Suicide Prevention.

,"Rachel Comey","Born outside of Hartford, Connecticut, Rachel Comey attended the University of Vermont as an art major with a focus on sculpture. After college, Comey moved to New York City to further pursue opportunities in the arts.Her earliest efforts in fashion came as costume designer for bands in the downtown music scene, earning her a place in the 2001 WhitneyBiennial.

In 2001, Comey launched her eponymous collection of menswear inspired by the young music scene in New York. Thanks to strong word of mouth, the collection proved a success, and she began to develop a loyal following.

By 2004 Comey had added womenswear and footwear to her burgeoning business. The women's collection quickly took off and developed its own grassroots following. Her collections became known for artful custom textiles, graceful modern silhouettes, and covetable footwear. The brand appeals to the intelligence and independence of her customers,who appreciate locally produced garments, thoughtful hand crafted details and an offbeat charm. All woven garments are made locally in midtown Manhattan while knitwear and footwear is made in Peru.

,"CAKES body","It all started with a case of NFO (nipple freak out) on the treadmill next to my boss. Awkward.

So we went on a journey to design something better than the foam sports bra padding and sticky nipple covers. 

We launched our first product - CAKES covers, the first grippy not sticky nipple covers designed for workout & swim - to friends & family with a single Instagram post. We had no investors, no social media following, and really no idea what we were going to do next. 

Very quickly, we started hearing from women going through various body & boob changes (adolescents going through puberty, breast feeding moms, breast-cancer survivors) that CAKES made them feel FREE in their clothes for the first time in a long time. They were wearing CAKES to go braless altogether or as a complement to their bralettes, workout tops, and bodysuits that they were living in. 

These women illuminated a huge opportunity and a much deeper purpose than we originally intended…

Today, CAKES body is on a mission to make every day feel as free as a no bra day, creating comfortable alternatives to the traditional bra while giving back to women’s health causes. 

With the help of our customers, we have donated over $1 million to breast cancer research and we are just getting started!","Retail Apparel and Fashion","11-50 employees","Privately Held","Los Angeles, CA","United States","cakesbody.com","https://www.linkedin.com/company/cakes-body"

Brendon’s free-thinking vision has long been at the heart of the movement merging the rebellious vitality of skate, surf, and music cultures with an innovative appreciation of classic menswear. Noah was created to realize this vision fully, in uncompromising pursuit of quality, integrity, and originality.

As a brand, Noah seeks to take a stand against many of the appalling practices of the fashion industry. Our clothes are made in countries, mills and factories where tradition, expertise and human dignity take precedence over the bottom line. We donate portions of our profits to causes we believe in. We speak out on issues we find important, and try to help give voice to the people and organizations we care about. We do this humbly, but with a firm belief that a responsible brand is a healthy one; that putting our values on the line pushes us to do our best.

The interests and influences that inspire our clothing fall under a large, inclusive, cross-generational umbrella. Our ideas come as much from the possibilities we see in fabrics and designs as our commitment to living active, engaged lifestyles. We believe in doing things our own way, with conviction, according to principles we determine ourselves. That’s the definition of punk rock to us, and we’re interested in the endless ways people from all walks of life manifest this attitude.

So, where does our name come from?

In the 1800s, Philadelphia was the country's garment production and style epicenter.  The term “Commonwealth” pays homage to a group of progressive Philadelphia tailors who founded a labor union to improve working conditions.

Their credo: “That is the most perfect government in which an injury to one is the concern of all.”  We at CMMP believe in the collective good and our company is run that way.

The term “Proper” denotes our belief that clothing, above all else, should fit properly. You can sacrifice a lot of things related to clothing, but fit is not one of them.

We've worked with thousands of clients over the last 15 years, finding that we care about fit and quality more than anyone in the industry. Indeed, a firm commitment to our brand's high standards is what binds us together. Finding the best designers, tailors and fabric - to deliver exceptional clothing - continues to be a relentless pursuit for us. That’s why our clients, who now span the globe, keep coming back.

Partow established an aesthetic rooted in minimalism, unstudied luxury, and a tension between modern femininity and masculinity. “My intention is for women to feel empowered. Clothing is an extension of self-expression, and should be dictated by what feels good, not by what trend presents.” From strength to empowerment, those two characteristics define her life both as a competitive, champion boxer and fashion designer.

Upon graduating from Parsons and working for top American designers such as Calvin Klein, Donna Karan, and John Varvatos for ten years, Nellie Partow launched her eponymous label, Partow, in 2011. In 2014, Partow was invited to give a TED Talk, and in 2015, she became a member of the prestigious Council of Fashion Designers of America.

Throughout her career as a designer, Partow has also been a competitive boxer, and in 2007, she fought in front of sold-out crowds at Madison Square Garden, winning the coveted New York Daily News Golden Gloves title. The sport has informed her vision for polished, but not precious clothing that women can truly wear in their everyday lives.

,"Love in Faith","Founders, Dave and Katie, met back in 2017. Brought together by their shared love for Jesus and their entrepreneurial spirit, they decided to start an online business that would make an impact in their community, something that would bring people together in a big way. They decided to start a clothing brand where the love of Jesus would be at the forefront. 

Growing up in the Christian community, they were discouraged by the faith-based apparel that was available to them. They were met with bland, impersonal Christian clothing that didn’t really reflect the fun and enthusiasm of being a believer in Christ. It was time they created their own faith-based apparel that showcased the unparalleled energy and joy that the Christian community had to offer—something that people would actually like to wear! 

They set off to work, learning as they went, spending every spare minute they could to grow the business in their own home. They worked tirelessly, often clocking in their workdays at 18 hours, 6 days a week, only taking days off to observe the Sabbath. At first, they were shipping orders out of their home, with the orders piling up and up and up on their kitchen counters. They knew something needed to change. They needed space—and a team to support their vision, too.

Since then, Love in Faith has become a beloved global brand. They’ve revolutionized what faith-based apparel can do for the community. With countless design options for clothing and accessories, they’ve provided a fun yet stylish way for believers to be supported in their faith, as well as a way to share the love of Jesus with the world. Through their passion to give back and be a source of hope, they’ve certainly proved that faith is always in style.

,"Cuts","In 2016, CUTS was created by Steven Borrelli when he found himself struggling to find the perfect t-shirt that had enough quality to be worn professionally at work yet also enough style for a night out. No matter where we looked nothing fit the bill, so he took matters into his own hands by creating something new, a product you could be proud to wear anytime, anywhere, without sacrificing comfort.

It wasn’t easy, but after countless hours of research and way too much coffee, we custom engineered our own Pyca fabric. We knew we needed something durable yet breathable which our tri-blend fabric delivers and then some.

We’ve all been there before, you find a shirt that fits well but then it is limited in colors, styles or even worse, it disappears from existence since it is part of a one-time seasonal collection. We’re changing that.

We believe the cut of your shirt matters most, so we created, ""shop by cut"" where you can choose between three bottom cuts (regular, split-hem, and elongated) and three collar options (crew, v-neck, and henley). Keeping what you wear most simple, yet sophisticated.

At CUTS, we are our own customers. We live the lifestyle. We are as authentic as it gets. Our promise is to keep you current with our styles, confident with the quality and ready for action with our versatility. We’re here for you and we’re here to revolutionize the way you shop.

Consciously designed. Ethically sourced. Built to last.  

Build it well, or not at all. That’s our mantra. We believe quality things come in small batches, which is why we add to our collection methodically and always aim to sell out. This cuts back on unnecessary waste and allows us to hand check every product that comes off our line. This is the opposite of fast fashion and we like it that way.


OUR STORY

Vincero was founded by longtime friends and colleagues Tim, Aaron and Sean. Our journey began as a production studio, designing and manufacturing products for traditional retail stores. In 2013 we reached a tipping point when we realized the current system had it all wrong. It favored cost over quality, mass-manufacturing over independent design and large department stores over local boutiques. We hated this. So in 2014 we quit our jobs and Vincero was born.


OUR PROMISE

We pride ourselves on our attention to detail and commitment to quality, of which can only be accomplished by our meticulous method of handcrafting goods. From the finest Italian leather, to surgical grade stainless steel each product will have a distinct look and quality feel.

,"elope, Inc.","Our Mission: Share Laughter, Wear Happiness
elope is dedicated to a vision of global happiness: everybody's laughing on planet earth.

OUR STORY
In 1988, Kevin and Keith Johnson embarked on a journey to the far corners of planet Earth collecting and designing outstanding hats that made everybody laugh. They loved making people smile almost as much as they loved telling stories about their adventures and spreading happiness. In 1993, the two brothers created elope (Everybody’s Laughing on Planet Earth) to share their love of laughter and style with the world. Almost 25 years later, that same joy of adventure, desire to make people happy, and passion for creative costuming inspires every decision we make.
 

WHIMSICAL WEARABLES
We know you want uniquely designed costumes and accessories that spark imagination and delight, so we work hard to create exceptionable wearables. Each of our original designs starts here at our world headquarters here in Colorado. Our team works closely with our manufacturing partners to ensure premium materials, superb craftsmanship, and excellent conditions for the people who help us bring our creations to life. We love to expand design boundaries almost as much as we love to make people happy, and we can't do that without the help of our entire team.
white rabbit smiles
 

WE DON’T PLAY WHEN IT COMES TO QUALITY
Our team works hard to source premium materials that make our products high quality and easy to wear. We monitor every step of the production process, and coordinate with our joint partnership factory to ensure that every aspect of the finished product makes our wearables stand out. We care deeply about details from the packaging to the product particulars.
 

FANTASTICAL SERVICE
It’s not just part of our mission -- it’s our personal investment in the success of your business. We care about you and your ability to delight your customers, and we will bend over backwards (in costume, of course) to make sure you’re happy with our products. Let us put a smile on your face with our clear, cheerful communication, accurate shipments, and friendly service.
 

SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY
elope strives to be socially responsible with a company-wide commitment to reusing materials at the factory level, a reducing our footprint with energy and materials conservation, and a year-round commitment to community volunteerism. In addition to the hours our team members put into supporting community organizations, we sponsor key events like the Waldo Waldo 5K (which we incubated for its first two years) and the St. Baldrick’s Foundation Head-Shaving Fundraiser.

,"Waggle","WAGGLE noun 
/ˈwæɡl/ 
a golfer's unique club movement made above the ball prior to taking a stroke

Golf term, golf brand. Simple, right? Sort of. Waggle’s origin is obviously there, but, like you, you’ll find our roots extend well beyond the tee box…

See, we’re rooted as much on the course as we are the deer stand and the duck blind. In coastal escapes, mountain adventures and cabins in the woods. We’re rooted in early mornings on the water and late nights around the campfire, happy hours at the local brewery and weekends on the family farm. In lacing up the skates, and in casting a line. Inspired by fresh air and open spaces, we’re rooted in all the things that make us, us—and all the things that make you, you.

Like trees to a forest, we’re rooted in the elements that give us life. These hobbies, interests and passions are what inspire us daily to create apparel that makes you say, “Wow, this was made for me.” Because, really, it was.

But, in case it wasn’t obvious by the roosters on our shirts, we’re not all introspect and sentiment. We’re equally about having a good time as striking an emotional cord. Like the best Dad jokes, we’re a little bit punny, a little bit out there and a whole lot to love (we think so, at least). 

If you’re game to stick around, we’re pretty confident you’ll find something you like. And, if not, don’t wander too far—your aha moment is probably just around the cart path (or hunting trail, if that’s more your thing).

,"TS Designs","TS Designs has set out to make the highest quality and most sustainable t-shirts on the market. We work with brands who want to provide their customers with responsibly made clothing that’s easy on the environment. 

In 2008, TS Designs became the first certified B Corporation in North Carolina, and the triple-bottom-line model still guides our business: People. Planet. Profit. 

We work with environmentally and socially conscious businesses and organizations, and have had some major accomplishments in the last 25 years: 

Mid 90s - We developed and patented REHANCE, a process that involves printing with water-based ink, then garment dyeing shirts. If you want to offer your customers a printed design in the fabric of shirts that never shrink, REHANCE is the solution you’ve been looking for. TS Designs founder Eric Henry and friend and mentor Sam Moore partnered to develop this process.
2008 - We launched Cotton of the Carolinas. Partnering with Sam Moore once again, TS Designs created over 500 jobs and a completely transparent supply chain when we brought the entire process from dirt-to-shirt back to within a 600-mile radius. Want to give your customers the option of shirts sourced and made in their backyard? Buy Cotton of the Carolinas tees.
2011 - We introduced the first certified organic cotton on the market. Partnership with two eastern North Carolina farmers made this possible. Today’s eco-friendly consumers are making ‘organic’ a priority. Why not offer it?

Founded in 1977 and located in Burlington, North Carolina, TS Designs sets the bar for corporate responsibility by cultivating responsible clothing with completely transparent supply chains. President Eric Henry is recognized widely for championing sustainability and supporting local farmers and mill workers.

,"GIGI C","GIGI C is a modern collection of luxury swimwear, activewear and loungewear founded in 2016 by then 16-year-old Gianna ""Gigi"" Caruso and her mother, Tina. The company was built on the belief that a functional swimsuit should enhance your style—never inhibit it. 

Born and raised in Southern California, Gigi grew up on the water and is an avid boater, wakeboarder, and swimmer. Unable to find quality swimwear that could keep up with her active lifestyle and still reflect her personal taste, she decided to take matters into her own hands. 

Together with Tina—a former clothing designer and swimsuit model—Gigi began deconstructing and cutting up her old swimsuits and refashioning them into chic styles that evolved into the brand’s signature aesthetic: clean lines, architectural shapes, and crisp, laser-cut details. Tina and Gigi also referenced Tina’s modeling photos for inspiration by redesigning the classic styles she wore with fresh modern twists.

Since its launch in 2017, GIGI C has become a go-to brand for women seeking glamorous designs without sacrificing comfort and functionality. Made from high quality luxurious European fabrics, each style goes through a rigorous fit process in the company’s Los Angeles design studio and is tested by Gigi to ensure unique style, glamorous lines, and durability. In 2019, GIGI C expanded into activewear with GIGI C Sport. The collection’s combination of high performance support and contemporary styles provide a seamless transition from the gym to beyond.","Retail Apparel and Fashion","11-50 employees","Privately Held","Los Angeles, CA","United States","gigicbikinis.com","https://www.linkedin.com/company/gigi-c"

HUMBLE BEGINNINGS
We’re proud to be a family owned business. For over 60 years we have been producing women’s wear, with our founder getting his start as a technician. It’s where we get our dedication to superior craftsmanship. To a perfectionist with a technician’s eye, a quality-made and comfortable pair of socks is just as satisfying as a well-oiled machine.

What’s not satisfying? Suffering for your fashion. Our founder thought the same thing. That’s why things changed when he took over, and a quest to provide that quality and comfort with stylish designs forever changed the way we approach fashion.

Comfort in fashion, fashion in versatility. That’s MeMoi.

UNIQUELY US, UNIQUELY YOU
We have the mentality of a small company, but our ideas are big. One of those ideas is that catering to diversity means being diverse. That’s why our team comes from all walks of life, with our designers pulling from the latest trends and their own unique creativity to create legwear and lingerie made with love. There’s nothing anonymous here – everything we do is personal and in-house from concept to shipping to customer service.

With the finest yarn, high quality designs, and hand-stitched details on many of our products, we dream of providing high fashion and day-through-night comfort to all wardrobes, no matter who you are.

WHERE WE’RE HEADED
We’ve come a long way since those early days. Today you can find our socks and leggings everywhere from small boutiques to major department stores and online marketplaces.

,"Botkier","Monica Botkier has always had an eye for detail. She began her career in fashion as a photographer, working on shoots for leading fashion magazines. A born and raised New Yorker, Monica was living and working downtown when she created the Trigger bag in 2003. Inspired by her busy downtown lifestyle, the Trigger became known as ‘the bag that launched an industry’ and resulted in immediate cult status.

Botkier has created a niche in the market where there was a void, an approachable designer brand. Botkier was the first independent designer accessories brand and Monica continues to run the business with the same innovation and passion as she did from its inception. Botkier accessories embody luxury through custom detailing, innovation and quality while focusing on functionality.

In July of 2007, Monica was recognized for her contributions to the world of accessory design and became a member of the esteemed Council of Fashion Designers of America.

For Spring 2008, in celebration of Botkier’s five-year anniversary, Monica brought the Botkier brand philosophy to footwear. Gracing the pages of Elle, Harper’s Bazaar, InStyle, Marie Claire, Glamour and Lucky; Botkier has established itself as a major contender.

,"Ebbets Field Flannels, Inc.","100% HAND CRAFTED 
Co-founder Jerry Cohen grew up in Brooklyn, not far from where the fabled stadium once stood in Flatbush. Jerry listened to his father tell stories of the colorful players of another era. He was proud of the fiercely independent neighborhood. And the Brooklyn Dodgers' heritage as the first major league team to integrate professional baseball in 1947, with the addition of Hall-of-Famer Jackie Robinson. 

FUELED BY A LIFE-LONG PASSION
Jerry was fascinated with sports emblems and uniforms. As a youngster, he would purchase baseball cards to see the uniform changes and colors rather than for the players. Fast-forward to 1987, when he was trying to find a vintage flannel baseball jersey to wear onstage with his rock & roll band. Which led to... 

MOVING INTO THE BIG LEAGUES
Not satisfied with the ""polyester era"" look and designs, Jerry became a bit obsessed, and eventually tracked down some old wool baseball flannel and had a few shirts made for himself. When people literally wanted to buy the shirt off his back, Ebbets Field Flannels was born. Focusing on non-major league history such as the Negro leagues and the pre-1958 Pacific Coast League gave the Company a unique twist, and brought relatively unknown baseball history to the public at large. 

100% HAND CRAFTED
Each limited edition garment is handmade from the world's largest inventory of 100% authentic, historical fabrics. All jerseys, ballcaps, jackets and sweaters are cut, sewn, or knit, from original fabrics and yarns.

30 YEARS AND COUNTING
Ebbets began in 1988 and we're still going strong. In fact, the legion of Ebbets fans continues to grow. We're still owned and run day-to-day by the original founders (instead of a corporation).

The company chose not to produce any of its products, preferring instead to hire independent suppliers in the US and Asia countries such as Taiwan, China, and Indonesia. These suppliers have built quality products to specifications and delivered them to precise delivery schedules. By outsourcing the production of our products to independent suppliers, we can focus all our attention and capabilities on product design and marketing. We are concerned about consumers' satisfaction and positive feedback. 
   We started small, but we will grow soon, very soon. We trust the vision we are selling to help our community achieve its goals.

ABOUT US

From the early 1930s, when Antoine Pasos made his first steps in the beauty and fashion world, through the 1970s, when the first high-compression shape wear products were created with breakthrough innovation, Squeem has celebrated women's curves through the decades, empowering their self-confidence in a sophisticated, sensual way.

THE ART OF CURVES

Squeem's Intelligent Fabric molds curves into perfection using a triple-filtered cotton lining for superior comfort. The 100% natural rubber exterior allows the garment to adapt to every sensual size and shape. Each one of our garments is specially designed to provide precise spot control and create homogeneous, all-over compression. As a result, Squeem products help you lose inches from your waistline in seconds, and leave you feeling your sexiest and most sensual ever. 

The benefits of Squeem's Intelligent Fabric technology include: 

- Superior shaping results 
- Firming and flattening of the stomach 
- Corrected posture 

OUR BUSINESS PARTNERS

Today Squeem's curve creating products are sold through some of the finest, leading retailers in the US and in Canada:

- Online retailers (Amazon, Bare Necessities, HerRoom, Classic Shapewear, YOOX, OuiHours)
- Plus-size retailers (Lane Bryant, Fashion to Figure)
- Specialty Chains (David's Bridal)
- Lingerie and bridal specialty stores (more than 400 doors nationwide)

We believe the world would be a more sensual place if women embraced their natural curves.

Meg empowers our customers through fashion and aims to uplift our communities by stocking woman-owned accessory brands, manufacturing in local factories and print shops, and collaborating with important causes. 

Our design philosophy since day one has focused on the real-life needs and real bodies of the women who buy our clothing. This philosophy has resulted in collections of feminine, versatile clothing that never goes out of style. We pride ourselves in having elevated service levels, provided by our trained stylists who are passionate about our customers and strive daily to understand their needs and create a wardrobe that works for them. 

The future of Meg is ever-changing. After a quarter century of work, Megan’s focus continues to be to inspire and mentor young creatives. She hopes to motivate the next generation to go after their dreams and find their audiences, by allowing her assistant designers to create their own original work and bring their designs to life to sell in Meg stores. This allows young designers to receive direct feedback from Meg customers, and learn how their work can influence and inspire others. The relationship that Megan has with her employees and her customers is what she enjoys most in her career as a designer, and is what has allowed her brand to flourish.","Retail Apparel and Fashion","11-50 employees","Self Owned","Brooklyn, New York","United States","megest1994.com","https://www.linkedin.com/company/meg-est-1994"

What makes The Warehouse Sale a sustainable business?

Then, we open the Warehouse Sale so we can sell at true cost, ditching retail mark-ups and saving these shoes from the landfill. It’s a win win!

EBY is a membership-based company driving profits with purpose. EBY, the perfect everyday seamless panty, boasts lightweight fabric that gives a second-skin feel and look while our patented flocking technology prevents sliding and riding. They work as one with your body, so you can run, shape, and shift the world.

Providing the utmost convenience for a replenishable product, EBY delivers underwear and purpose monthly, every other month, or quarterly to its community members. Styles and frequency can be customized to the author’s preference.

EBY repositions underwear as a tool for empowerment rather than one of seduction. Ten percent of net sales go to the Seven Bar Foundation to empower women out of poverty and into business through microfinance with a small loan. It’s what we call a first break, and that can be as little as $80 or as large as $7,000. This loan enables an underprivileged woman to start or grow her business. As she becomes self-sufficient, the cycle of poverty is broken. Loans are repaid and passed to another woman, creating a multiplier effect. EBY consistently fuels this loop so that it never ends.  We’re not about one-time solutions or patching up holes with pretty pink BAND-AIDs, though we love a colorful accessory. We want to consistently fuel the empowerment of women through business. 

We sustainably source our products in a factory in Sri Lanka that respects the balance between environmental, social, and economic performance. Our factory’s core company pillar focuses on Women’s Empowerment Principles, where we were jointly developed by the United Nations.

From a long line of revolutionaries and outlaws comes Western Couture’s First Family, Double D Ranch. Since 1990, the women of Double D Ranch have been blazing a trail that has turned a garage operation into a 25 year company that is able to hold it’s own in today’s world of fast-paced fashion.

Creative Director, Cheryl McMullen, along with her team of designers, produce four collections a year. Each one leaves customers astounded at the creativity and brilliance that has defined the brand for a quarter of a century.

However, their success as fashion industry professionals has not been what defines them over the years. It is their ability to embrace culture and heritage as mavericks and throw the formulas and rulebooks right out the pick-up truck window. At the core of everything they’ve created lies their unconditional love of their family.

,"Grace and Lace","Melissa was always a DIY girl. She grew up with a mom who always made homemade play dough and birthday cakes, and sewed her dance costumes. So Melissa started sewing at a very young age. 

In the spring of 2010 she was 5 months pregnant with a little girl. At a routine doctor's visit, she was suddenly given the devastating news that without surgical intervention she would give birth to her daughter within 24 hours and she would not survive. Melissa was rushed into emergency surgery to try to save her, and spent the remainder of her pregnancy in the hospital on strict bedrest. The days were incredibly LONG, and since she couldn't even sit up, she just had to do something with her hands! She started with a vision to crochet this tiny baby girl a blanket. And thus began and spurred her desire to sew.

For two weeks she was hospitalized until doctors couldn't stop the labor any longer. Their very tiny, but oh-so-perfect, baby girl was born. With lungs not yet developed enough to survive on her own, the Lord took her straight to Heaven.

Though heart-wrenching and devastating, we truly believe that out of this great tragedy has come our greatest victory.

Her love for sewing and all things knit continued to grow. In late fall of 2011, she made her 1st pair of lacey leg warmers. Everywhere she went, people would stop and ask her where she got them. She put them for sale online and within days she was overwhelmed with orders she couldn't possibly fulfill herself! 

Today, Grace and Lace has become a full-blown women’s apparel company with trademarked designs, a full studio and warehouse, and friends and family as staff. A portion of every sale goes toward building orphanages in India!

It has been an exciting journey and we are beyond grateful for the many doors that have opened for us over the years. We are also incredibly grateful to have the most amazing mentors and team members, and loyal customers who keep coming back for more.

,"Sevenly","Sevenly is a social good lifestyle brand that uses art and fashion to raise funds and awareness for a new charity every week. Sevenly exists to bring funding and awareness to the world’s greatest causes. Beautiful Cause Art created specifically for the Cause of the Week donates $7 to the designated charity. All other purchases donate 7% to Sevenly's charity partners.

Mission
Our overall goal is to activate intentional generosity and love for others, but it’s a process. Our model is a funnel. There are millions of people who have never supported a charity before, so asking for a monetary donation might be weird. So we thought, let’s encourage people to donate their social influence first. Next, let’s allow people to purchase a product that gives money to a cause they support, and last, let’s encourage these donors to connect deeper with these charities.

Visit us at http://www.sevenly.org/

General Information
Across the globe, there are thousands of charities in every category imaginable. 74% of worthy, much needed charities, go out of business every single year. The problem is a lack of awareness, funding, and following. Sevenly was formed to help these charities by selling Tee's to raise awareness, increase following and provide additional funding.

Our founders Harald and Lynn Husum launched the company from their 600 square foot apartment in the summer of 2003.

Since launch, Appaman has since enjoyed tremendous exposure from A-list high-profile customers, won numerous unique recognitions and awards, and enjoy a “cult-like” following amongst celebrities and key influencers worldwide. Our clothes can be found in high-end department stores and specialty stores nationwide and at Appaman.com.

,"SOFTIES","The Softies’ story begins in 2005 in Minnesota.  After 40 years of working in women’s clothing sales and manufacturing, Dennis Murphy, with the help of his wife, Peggy, decided to start his own company.  Dennis had been working with his long-time designer, Lily, on a new fabrication that would regulate body temperature, wick perspiration, and maintain its incredible softness for the life of the garment.  When Peggy was diagnosed with leukemia in 2006 and began a journey that spans to this day, Dennis knew his fabric would bring comfort to Peggy during the many long nights that lay ahead.  Softies was born.

Softies Sleepwear grew steadily, and Tim Murphy joined his parents in their small family business in 2008.  They officed from the family home, warehoused in the garage, and were vigilant of weather (rain and snow), as outgoing orders continued to build on the driveway.  Customers were eager for more products, and soon Softies introduced their Ultra-Soft Loungewear and Luxury Robe collections.  Both as a celebration and out of necessity, all three Murphy’s moved into their first warehouse in the fall of 2011.  In 2012, Tim stepped into the role of his dad, having learned from the best. 

A decade later, Softies is proud to be keeping its faithful customers luxuriously soft and cozy worldwide.  What started in Minnesota as a family business has now become a brand recognized by hundreds of media outlets, including Oprah’s Favorite Thing for seven consecutive years! 

Most important, Softies' mission for every customer has remained the same since the very first days in the Murphy house:  We use only the softest fabrics to make you look and feel your best!","Retail Apparel and Fashion","11-50 employees","Privately Held","Norcross, Georgia","United States","softiespjs.com","https://www.linkedin.com/company/softies"

,"Rags","Hello there! We're so stoked you've found us on LinkedIn. RAGS is best known for the revolutionary 'Rag' - a snapless, buttonless kids romper which features soft, stretchy fabric and a patent-pending elastic neckline. In 2014, Rachel Nilsson began selling handmade clothing on Instagram. Four years later, her company features bi-weekly limited edition releases, which often sell out in minutes, and has cultivated a passionate community of Raggers.

Rachel Nilsson, founder and CEO, started RAGS while striving to make ends meet with 3 boys during her husband's grad school years. With a wriggly toddler of her own, she wanted to create a romper that was functional but didn't compromise on fashion or fit. She sewed one of her husband’s old shirts into the ‘Rag’ and the craze began. Fast forward four years and here we are, a rapidly growing company with a bright future.

We’ve stuck to our limited edition model, which means we’re always bringing new goodness bi-weekly. The Rag will always be our staple, but we’ve added more products along the way, including baby pouches, kid and adult tees, hats, and more. Although it still feels like a dream sometimes, we’ve been featured on ABC's Shark Tank, highlighted in Vogue, Huffington Post, US Weekly, Forbes, Pop Sugar, Brit & Co, and more. 

Seeing how far we’ve come in a few years still astounds us. Our amazing community of Raggers plays such a pivotal role in keepin’ this train chuggin’ and we love all of the support through the years.

,"Smathers & Branson","In 2004, while roommates at Bowdoin College, we decided to start a company that offered needlepoint belts. We had each been gifted a needlepoint belt from our then girlfriends and became intrigued with these unique accessories. After looking to buy finished belts, we realized that there wasn’t a company that featured these timeless items. From the start, our goal was to make the belts more available, attractive and affordable. We had always shared an entrepreneurial spirit and after discovering a concept that we were passionate about, we started working on the idea that has become Smathers & Branson.

Our biggest challenge was finding and training skilled artisans. With our options quickly running out, we decided to spend the fall in Vietnam. Meeting our stitchers face to face enabled us to perfect our product to meet the high quality standards we set. Without realizing it we had laid the groundwork for a cottage industry that, within a few years, would employ and provide opportunities for thousands of people. As our company continues to grow, we have the satisfaction that our artisan’s level of success grows as well.

We began testing the market in the spring of 2005, and quickly, the once treasured gift became the engine of a growing business. The positive response to the needlepoint belts allowed us to expand to a full line of needlepoint accessories. Through our licensing agreements, we now offer needlepoint products for many of the nation’s best universities and colleges, Major League Baseball teams, National Hockey League teams and fraternities and sororities. In addition, we can create custom products with unique patterns for schools, clubs, and organizations as well as one of a kind Life Belts and monogrammed products.

Smathers & Branson defines our mission: “to offer the finest products with customer service to match.”

,"Bespoke Manufacturing Company","Bespoke Manufacturing Company has created a way to make on-demand apparel
manufacturing sustainable, scalable, and profitable.
The USA will always have difficulty competing against foreign
labor costs. To compete effectively we must offer brands what offshore
cannot by:
• Reducing or eliminating inventory
• Personalizing each garment
• Making it fit using “made to measure” (MTM)
• Shipping it within hours of receiving the order
Inventory is the biggest single reason that brands fail. Product cycles are long,
sometimes over a year. Capital is tied up for long periods of time in the hope that
products will sell according to projections. This time gap makes sales and inventory
projections impossible to predict with accuracy. The result is an enormous waste in time
and money and an increased risk.
The volatile nature of the fashion industry makes it difficult to have the right inventory, in
the right size, in the right color, at the right time impossible. The BMC model changes
the paradigm of:
Make it/hope it sells to Sell it/then make it
BMC is an ideal manufacturing partner for any size apparel brand that strives to
reshape its supply chain or develop disruptive business models. In conjunction with our
business partner iCreate.fashion there is a clear path for small and large brands to
easily migrate from long runs to on-demand.","Retail Apparel and Fashion","11-50 employees","Self Owned","Phoenix, Arizona","United States","bmc.fashion","https://www.linkedin.com/company/bespoke-manufacturing-company"

Her experiential in-store events and eye for emerging design talent mixed with venerable brands have established Capitol as the premiere boutique of the South, transporting women’s wardrobes into a magical world of expressive style. Capitol is a journey to dressing well, and Laura has long guided that mission by offering a combination of femininity and attitude, with lots of patterns and color, never holding back an opportunity for a woman to stand out in a crowd.

A native of Charlotte and a graduate of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Laura’s vision for Capitol was influenced by sentimental shopping trips with her mother, which while growing up required drives to Atlanta and New York to visit the premier department stores and specialty shops of the time.  Laura noticed an opportunity in her hometown for the presentation of European labels, as well as emerging designers, to likeminded women with a sartorial eye and who were enthusiastic about discovery. As one of the country’s fastest-growing cities, Charlotte attracts both entrepreneurs and enthusiasts in arts, culture, dining, and hospitality, and is a popular headquarters-based community for the athletic, business, banking, and manufacturing economies.  This expansion has prompted local business travel, networking, and social activities, and therefore the need for a well-equipped shop with a global point of view for the Southern sensibility. 

For over two decades, Capitol’s interior has blossomed with the brilliant hues and bold silhouettes from the likes of Balenciaga, Dries Van Noten, Marc Jacobs, Marni, Celine, and Saint Laurent, and helped seed Charlotte’s embrace of emerging talent such as Irene Neuwirth, Of Rare Origin, Olympia Le-Tan, and Huishan Zhang. Most of Laura’s curating comes from a genuine affection for the designers themselves, many of whom she has feted in her store’s signature space—a lush atrium with a vege","Retail Apparel and Fashion","11-50 employees","Privately Held","Charlotte, North Carolina","United States","shop-capitol.com","https://www.linkedin.com/company/capitol-clothing-co"

,"ORTTU","WHAT WE BELIEVE

We no longer have to live by the rules that other people set. How we live, who we love, and how we dress, that’s up to each of us. We hope you’re doing all of that. But we know it isn’t easy. Finding out who we are deep inside is a journey that demands we act boldly, bravely, and with love.

We’re told to conform, to play it safe, to be careful about being different or standing out. And those who tell us that, some of them just want what they think is best for us.

Maybe they don’t understand, but just because we don’t want to live like them doesn’t mean we don’t love them. It just means that we need to be totally free to be ourselves, unapologetically. And maybe they don’t realize it, but being different isn’t about dropping out; it’s about stepping up.

WHY WE STARTED ORTTU

We wanted to create a brand that was more than just a clothing line. One that wasn’t about following the trends but about representing the innermost feelings of the wearer. We wanted to create a style for men who are in touch with their individuality, strength, and inner beauty and who aren’t afraid to express it on the outside. And we wanted to build a community around that.

Those who wear our clothing might not know each other, but they recognise each other. And no matter where we are in the world, we are drawn together by a love of beauty, a belief in self-expression, and a love of the sensual, the spiritual, and the playfully sexual.

Wearing ORTTU means no longer hiding your true self. It's a declaration: I am here and this is who I am.

COMMUNITY

For us, ORTTU is more than clothing. It’s also a community. It’s your journey of self-discovery and self-expression that inspires us. And your willingness to express on the outside what you feel on the inside that makes us obsess about every little detail.

From visiting our site to ordering and wearing our latest garments, we want your experience to be one of absolute pleasure.","Retail Apparel and Fashion","11-50 employees","Privately Held","New York","United States","orttu.com","https://www.linkedin.com/company/orttu"

,"Southern Shirt (SSCO)","Founded in 2006, Southern Shirt has rapidly grown to a be a major player in the battle for apparel supremacy. Tired of the same scratchy t-shirts with their bland designs and no heart, Southern Shirt’s founders set out to rethink the t-shirt from the ground up. Starting with a 100% cotton t-shirt and an oversized fit, Southern Shirt stepped up the game with a garment and enzyme wash process that gave their shirts a super-soft feel and a great faded look. These extra steps in their process were enough to turn a simple piece of fabric into what would ultimately become their new favorite shirt.

With a super-comfortable, breathable, throw-it-on-and-forget style, the only obstacle left to tackle was the stale, cookie-cutter designs that every other company was offering. Pulling from their southern heritage and love of the laid-back lifestyle, eye-popping and unique designs that embodied their favorite parts of life soon began to flow freely onto their canvas.

Fast-forward almost a decade, and throughout the full catalog of t-shirts, tank tops, pullovers, accessories and more that they now offer, you can really see how Southern Shirt continues to live and breathe the same core values that birthed who they are today. If you’re looking for something to throw on that feels good, looks good, and won’t leave you eating ramen for the next two weeks, the comfy life is now only a click away.","Retail Apparel and Fashion","11-50 employees","Privately Held","Birmingham, Alabama","United States","southernshirt.com","https://www.linkedin.com/company/southernshirt"

,"The Wheat Collection","In 2017, with a steadfast belief in the transformative power of fashion, husband and wife Huw Collins and Molly Shaheen wanted to open a boutique that would offer something unique and refined to the world. Huw had recently completed filming for the popular television show, Pretty Little Liars and Molly was eager to capitalize on her wealth of business experience and innate entrepreneurial spirit. Whilst on a trip to Paris, Molly and Huw visited Gabrielle Chanel’s original apartment at 31 Rue Cambon, above the first Chanel location. The home of Chanel represented Molly’s ‘holy grail’, with her love for Chanel’s revolutionary influence and timeless designs stretching back as long as she could recall. During the visit, they noticed numerous symbols and motifs of WHEAT adorning the space. As the story was told to them, Chanel formed a strong belief that WHEAT represented an opportunity to transcend her circumstances, after being born into poverty, and that keeping symbols of it close by would always bring her prosperity and abundance, always reminding her of her roots. Subsequently, Molly suggested the new retail venture should be named WHEAT, an opportunity to represent their future as well as their roots, and thus, WHEAT was born.

WHEAT embodies the sense of wanderlust in modern travelers. Our retail spaces offer curated collections of casual luxury essentials that create comfort in the familiar and delight in the unexpected. With stores across North America and the Caribbean, the success of WHEAT and the expansion of the brand continues in earnest.

,"Original Stitch","Men are at their best when they’re dressed in a way that makes them feel like themselves. But they face a unique challenge, a balancing act, when trying to do so. They want to be noticed for who they are and not blend in with the crowd, but never in a way that looks try- hard. As a result, many guys just end up skipping the idea of personal style altogether and settling for whatever’s easy.

At Original Stitch, our mission is to make it effortless for men to dress in a way that feels right and reflects who they are, no matter what that means to them. We offer the leading digital fit- and-design platform and work directly with Japanese craftsmen and factories, bringing high quality custom shirts within reach.

The custom shirt market is a crowded space, largely characterized by throwback-y, heritage, and fit-focused brands. But our vision is much more than that. So when we were deciding on a name, we knew it had to evoke our unique combination of Japanese craftsmanship and our forward-thinking nature.

We landed on Original Stitch.

Whether it’s your career, a night out, or your sense of style, Original Stitch stands for becoming something meaningful, no matter what that means for you.

,"Sh*t That I Knit","Sh*t That I Knit is a knitwear company based out of Boston, MA. Founder and CKO (Chief Knitting Officer), Christina Pardy, learned how to knit as a 10 year old from the CMO (Chief Mom Officer) in Cape Breton, Nova Scotia. After years of knitting gifts for her friends, Christina decided to leave her 9-5 job to pursue her passion for knitting, bringing people together, and having a good laugh. STIK was born. 

Since that time, STIK has become more than just a knitwear company that creates beautiful, high-quality products. The brand is the backbone of a community made up of people from around the world and is committed to making a positive social impact. When order volume grew beyond the capacity of Christina and the “CMO”, they turned to a talented team of women in Peru to bring the products to life. Working with companies like STIK allows these women the option to knit from home, enabling them to take care of their children while earning an income to support their families. All of STIK’s products are made in Lima, Peru using high-quality, sustainable materials. The line has expanded to include handmade beanies, versatile wraps, and cozy ponchos.

STIK has been featured in several prominent publications, most notably on the cover of The Boston Globe, Forbes, NBC Nightly News, Boston Magazine, Bostinno, The Improper Bostonian, Refinery29, Real Simple, Inc., A-Plus ad many more.","Apparel and Fashion","11-50 employees","Self Owned","Boston, MA","United States","shitthatiknit.com","https://www.linkedin.com/company/shit-that-i-knit"

,"Cowgirl Tuff Company","Cowgirl Tuff Company is western apparel for women of all sizes that incorporates trendy fashion without compromising comfort. 

In 1999, Lisa Bollin had a dream to own her own clothing company. With the support of her husband and partner, Kirk, and their daughter Lexie, they started on a journey. That journey has brought them so far, inspired many and has become a dream come true!

Cowgirl Tuff Co. started in the little town of Litchfield, MN. The company that is busting out at the seams sits in the middle of a field that was farmed by Lisa’s father, Wayne (aka Grandpa). Lisa started printing tops and retailing them at many of the major barrel racing events throughout the U.S. When she realized she couldn’t keep up with the demand, she looked into wholesale. Lisa went to her first wholesale market in 2004, and at that market landed 18 stores!

Over the last 7 years, 18 stores have turned into 1,500 and are still growing. In 2008, Lisa wanted to try her luck in designing a fashionable western jean, with an emphasis on comfort. That she did! Her jean line is making a name for itself in a BIG way in the apparel market. Lisa is not slowing down, she has decided to get the cowboys looking fashionable as well. That men's line, B.Tuff Jeans, launched in 2010.

Lisa’s journey has been a dream come true. She has hit bumps along the way, but with those bumps, she has always lived by her motto: “Even though you’ve been bucked, kicked, bit & stomped…NEVER GIVE UP!","Retail Apparel and Fashion","11-50 employees","Privately Held","Cokato, Minnesota","United States","cowgirltuff.com","https://www.linkedin.com/company/cowgirl-tuff-co."

,"JessaKae","JessaKae Maddocks who owns and founded JessaKae with her husband Jordan, is the CEO and head designer of JessaKae, a designer dress and mommy-and-me brand that focuses on making women of every size feel elegant and powerful. A serial entrepreneur, Jessa combined her love of photography, fashion, and design to create JessaKae in 2016, and continues to champion size inclusion in her clothing with exclusive designs from XXS-5X.

Jessa grew up watching her plus-size grandmother scour catalogs for pieces that fit because stores didn't carry her size. Often, her grandmother would have to return the clothing because it didn't fit well. With this experience from her grandmother, Jessa made it her personal mission to do her part to change the industry and offer inclusive sizing.

JessaKae started in a basement in Draper, Utah. Operations eventually expanded into the kitchen where we replaced dining room tables with warehouse shelving. The space was quickly dubbed “Jessa’s sweatshop” as it wasn’t uncommon to open the front door and 6-7 people would be inside folding clothes and fulfilling orders.

JessaKae has become a top competitor in designer dress wear forging the way for inclusive sizing across the globe with the knowledge that feeling beautiful has a significant impact on feeling powerful.","Retail Apparel and Fashion","11-50 employees","Self Owned","Bluffdale, Utah","United States","jessakae.com","https://www.linkedin.com/company/jessakae"

,"Indosole","The idea for Indosole was conceived on a surf trip to Bali, Indonesia in 2004. A couple of young Californians were struck by the environmental issues faced by Indonesians, and inspired by an unusual pair of sandals they found there. By combining these two things, they created a unique solution to the problem of pollution in Indonesia in the form of a product that was both fashionable and functional.

RE-PURPOSE:
With “Re-purposed” products, Indosole offers the most organic, toxic free and environmentally sustainable production process. There is no melting down, off gassing, or reforming of any material—just strong hands and minds.

RE-IMAGINE:
“Repurposing” is an art of transformation. We learned this from our commitment to the local Balinese crafts people, the wise and resourceful artisans who taught us that waste could be reimagined, transformed into something purposeful. Through our strong relationship, we have saved thousands of tires from overflowing and overcrowded Indonesian landfills. And the thing is, we’ve only started to get our hands dirty. The more tires we save means a lower production of tire-derived fuel on the island, less landfills; and also, more shoes, more ideas, and an altogether healthier way of living.

RE-BIRTH:
To enhance every aspect of your life, Indosole uses only locally sourced and animal free materials during its transformation of waste into fashionable and functional items. It is our dream to provide you with footwear that not only eliminates waste, but also, can give it a new life. Please join us on our quest to save 1 million waste tires from Indonesian landfills.","Apparel and Fashion","11-50 employees","Public Company","San Francisco, CA","United States","indosole.com","https://www.linkedin.com/company/indosole"

,"Flag Nor Fail","Flag Nor Fail Takes pride in our approach to the apparel world.  The pride, work ethic, and passion is what separates us from other brands.

Sadly, it has become common to mindlessly pump out large quantities of clothing and rake in profits — our line means more to us than that! 

From our very beginning, we have endeavored to provide our customers with limited hand printed items that represent who we are.

We want to create clothing that is unique; clothing that when you wear it, you KNOW it was made to represent something more than a clothing line. We want our customers to wear our apparel with the same pride that went into producing each print. Our customers and our fans are among only a few people in the world to own these unique and limited items.

The beauty of the print process comes from the effort going into each and every print. All prints are one of a kind with characteristics that make them truly their own. The unique details are what makes these items so special. Everything from the amount of ink applied and laid on the item, to the placement on the item; all of these factors change slightly from one item to the next. 

We put the work into every product, before it ever gets to you. The printing process is a personal experience, and we devote our time and effort into creating each individual piece. We take pride in all of our goods and so should you.

We thank you for your loyalty, support, and belief in all of our brands as you continue to put the work in, everyday, in every aspect of your lives.","Retail Apparel and Fashion","11-50 employees","Privately Held","Kalispell, MT","United States","flagnorfail.com","https://www.linkedin.com/company/flag-nor-fail"

We make gear and apparel for capable people.

WHO WE ARE :
Triple Aught Design is a small American company making a splash in a market traditionally filled with $100+ million dollar mega brands.

We make high quality gear and apparel in the USA, purpose built for the capable individual. Our warehouse and HQ are based in the San Francisco, CA region.

We employ about 35 full time employees and are responsible for another 100-200 American jobs through our contract workers.

95% OF WHAT WE MAKE AND DELIVER INTO THE MARKET IS MADE IN USA.

MADE IN USA :
LESS THAN 3% OF THE CLOTHING AMERICANS BUY ARE ACTUALLY ‘MADE IN USA.’
""Made in USA"" is a label protected by the Federal Trade Commission. In order for an item to be called such, the item must be made within the United States' borders from ""all or virtually all"" American parts.

While a pair of Force 10’s might be Made In USA by TAD, there are dozens of American companies that benefit from the commerce of the product. From the Ripstop fabric, thread, D-rings, webbing, zippers, and cordage. All are products other companies specialize in manufacturing that we use in our finished products. 

Focusing on Made In USA helps strengthen that connection of American companies. When you buy Made In USA products, you aren’t just helping the American company selling the product, you are helping the other American companies that supply the raw materials. This boosts jobs, which boosts our economy, and circulates that currency within our own communities.  Not to mention, makes us (as a Country) less dependent on others and more self reliant.

,"Keaton Row","We believe a woman’s style is a projection of her perspectives, attitudes, and lifestyle. It’s an expression of who she is and how she feels, and the pieces in her wardrobe are the means of that expression.

But the world of fashion can be impersonal and difficult to translate from runway to reality, and the cost of traditional personal styling is prohibitive.

So we started Keaton Row.

Our stylists work directly with women to help them build versatile everyday wardrobes comprised of fewer, better pieces by guiding them to make meaningful purchases each season. By styling new purchases with pieces they already own, we help them define their unique styles so they never have to wonder what to wear—or how to wear it—again.","Retail Apparel and Fashion","11-50 employees","Privately Held","New York, NY","United States","keatonrow.com","https://www.linkedin.com/company/keaton-row"

,"Stars Design Group","Developing Apparel Programs from Design to Delivery - Established in 1993, as Stars Apparel International, eventually expanding and evolving into Stars Design Group, Inc. in 2000. Our company's global headquarters are located in St. Louis, Missouri with two offices in India. 

We have created a unique business model that allows us to develop apparel programs for brands and businesses who need the infrastructure of highly experienced personnel, a full service design staff using 2D & 3D PHOTO-real artwork, an incredible development and sourcing team, and a global network of over 67 hand-selected factories in 14 countries. 

These assets also allow us to work closely with well established brands, corporations and retailers which has resulted in strong, long-term relationships. 

RECOMMENDATION:
The decision to add a vendor is a critical one especially for a premium brand with demanding customers and stakeholders. The potential vendor is not 'just' a vendor, but a partner in the development process and a conduit to excellence in the delivery of quality products, from concept inception to execution, in timely delivery and follow through. It is a relationship that is critical to success. It is a continuing journey without end: - if you are fortunate to find a true partner in the process.
I have no hesitation in saying that Stars Design Group are best-in-class. No matter what the business model, they have the capability, passion and drive to bring it to life and make it happen, as they did, and continue to do, with Harley-Davidson.

,"THAKOON","Where modern cool meets easy sophistication, THAKOON is made for those who believe good fashion shouldn’t be so hard. Launched in September 2019 by celebrated Thai-American designer, Thakoon Panichgul, this line of timeless essentials reimagines the everyday wardrobe.

Panichgul started his career as a fashion editor for Harper’s Bazaar, covering runway designers and chasing style news. Wanting to try his hand at designing, he enrolled at Parsons School of Design in New York City. In 2004, Panichgul created his first ready-to-wear collection centered on pieces that were, at once, beautiful and easy to wear. An overnight success, he was championed by both the press and those in the public eye, appeared in countless spreads of major magazines, and became the go-to designer for many celebrities.

Recently, he made a surprising move: he took a two-year break. During that time, he realized that loud and flashy fashion noises were drowning out good, simple, and affordable designs. It led him to relaunch his brand as a direct-to-consumer line of functional, beautiful, and well-designed wardrobe essentials.","Retail Apparel and Fashion","11-50 employees","Privately Held","New York, New York","United States","thakoon.com","https://www.linkedin.com/company/thakoon"

,"Kirrin Finch","Kirrin Finch is a conscientious clothing company, founded by Brooklyn-based couple Laura Moffat and Kelly Sanders Moffat, that will meet the growing demand for gender-defying fashion by creating menswear-inspired apparel designed to fit a range of women's bodies. The inspiration for the business was borne out of our own frustration at being unable to find clothes that match our personal style. As women who tend to gravitate towards button-up shirts and bow ties, we often find ourselves envying the clothes in the men's section, but are always frustrated because they are not designed to fit a woman's body.

Although we don't come from a traditional fashion background, Kelly was a teacher in the NYC public school system and Laura has a Neuroscience PhD and is a former marketing consultant, we are no longer willing to settle for ill-fitting menswear or overly frilly womenswear. So, we decided to join the movement that rejects traditional stereotypes and gives people the freedom to be their true selves.","Apparel and Fashion","11-50 employees","Partnership","New York","United States","kirrinfinch.com","https://www.linkedin.com/company/kirrin-finch"

,"Naeem Khan","Born and raised in Mumbai, Khan grew up in a world surrounded by culture, architecture, art, history and design. As a boy, he cultivated a vast knowledge of textiles under the watchful eyes of his grandfather and father, both of whom designed intricate clothing worn by Indian royal families. Khan ultimately moved to the United States as a teenager to become a designer and launched his career as an apprentice for legendary American designer Halston at the age of 20. During his time with Halston, he immersed himself in the ethos of modern restraint and learned the craft of draping and cutting fabric to create a clean, elegant and timeless silhouette. Khan eventually merged this design philosophy with the knowledge he gained from his family’s business to nurture his own unique style, and the Naeem Khan design aesthetic was born.

Khan launched his eponymous collection in 2003 and began selling at Bergdorf Goodman, Neiman Marcus and Saks Fifth Avenue. Since then his collections have adorned glamorous women around the world, including Beyoncé, Jennifer Lopez, Taylor Swift, Rachel McAdams, First Lady Michelle Obama, Queen Noor of Jordan, and the Duchess of Cambridge, Kate Middleton, among others.

But let's be honest here, golf can be stuffy and somewhat boring. William Murray Golf is about infusing the game with energy and a little irreverence, while still respecting the game. Who says you have to wear a striped polo and play the traditional 18 holes? A new tradition begins.

,"Berek","Jack Zyman started BEREK over 40 years ago.  His inspiration for “art you can wear” sweaters originated during a trip to remote South American villages where he spotted colorful hand-knit sweaters.  This quickly became identified as the BEREK signature product: “statement” sweaters that enable the wearer to identify herself with a particular theme.  At this point, Jack had no way of knowing that his vision would acquire a lasting reputation as the originator of the hand-knit novelty sweater.  BEREK sweaters were introduced in 1977 and immediately generated a “ revolution in the fashion world.”  After all of these years, the name BEREK continues to be held in the highest esteem among those who know and collect “art you can wear” sweaters.

  BEREK produces sweater knits, jackets, dresses, handbags, pajamas, t-shirts, shoe bags, spa wraps, velour suits, home furnishing accessories, and more… An outstanding team of specialty designers, headed by Jill Rogers, designs the products.

,"Barefoot Tess","Tess is, in many ways, your typical twentysomething girl. She loves movies, tennis, sushi, her dog Hank and her hometown of Baltimore — and most of all, she loves clothes. Since she can remember, she has spent hours poring over fashion sites and magazines to carefully dissect what designers are showing and celebrities are wearing, and she firmly believes that the thrill one gets from wearing a new dress is the best mood elevator out there.
But Tess had a problem. For years, when she had nearly succeeded in putting together a perfect look — perhaps an outfit that mixed a timeless investment piece with a trendier item or a cheeky vintage find — she found herself getting ‘tripped’ up in the same place: what to do with her woefully, inescapably bare feet. Wearing an 11, she was unable to find shoes in her size that met her aesthetic standards; the suggestions of salespeople to try something in a men’s or comfort style met with her rightful indignation.

Fortunately, Tess refused to settle for these sub-par options and in 2005, she enlisted her mother to help her found Barefoot Tess. Their mission was, and is, to provide the best in footwear — be it a $15 flip-flop or an $800 boot — to large-footed, fashion-conscious women everywhere. Tess's love of fashion has never been about how much something costs, what size it is or who designed it. It’s about style, and style shouldn’t stop at size 10.","Apparel and Fashion","11-50 employees","Privately Held",,"United States","barefoottess.com","https://www.linkedin.com/company/barefoot-tess_2"

You wore your mesh underpinning with you grey flannel suit to the board room .
You slipped on your roll waist mesh pant for your favorite yoga class.
Sweet Pea looked great throughout all three of your pregnancies.
The girls loved the way you looked at the charity event in your coral baby doll top.
The moms think you’re edgy when you carpool in your printed mesh caftan.

,"Royal and Reese","Tara, Whitney and Kait are no strangers to business. Growing up with an entrepreneurial father, the three sisters had a front row seat to the work and dedication it takes to develop, run and grow a business. Fortified with the confidence he instilled in them from a young age, the three decided to put their knowledge to work and open their own business.

With respective backgrounds in business, studio art and fashion merchandising, the foundation for Royal and Reese was laid long before the first leggings were designed. It wasn’t until Whitney and Tara had their first children, Rivers Royal Bold and Brecken Reese, that an idea began to form.

Very quickly, Whitney discovered that finding fashionable, trendy baby clothes, specifically for her baby boy, was nearly impossible. So the sisters put their heads and skills together and launched Royal + Reese. With their online boutique baby and toddler clothing, Royal + Reese specializes in exclusively designed screen-printed tees and leggings all made in the USA.

Beyond the bond of sisterhood, Tara, Whitney and Kait share a vibrant faith in the Lord. Along with making great kids clothing, the sisters behind Royal + Reese have a strong calling to use their business to connect with other moms and women.

A message from Tara, Whitney and Kait:
“We have a platform to encourage a future generation with tender touches, encouraging words and expressions of value.  We have been given the privilege of passing on hope to others.

Duckfeet are known for their minimalist, foot-formed design that offers ample room for toes to move and air to reach the feet.

All-natural, shock-absorbing crepe rubber is used for the outsole, which can be re-soled. 100% premium European sheep wool lined models, like the popular Århus & Odense, are available for cold-weather wear.

Each pair of Duckfeet is handcrafted in Europe without the use of synthetic materials. Exclusive-quality terracare leather is sourced close to home in Germany and is treated using environmentally friendly and sustainable processes. All other components are sourced within the European Union.

No two pair of Duckfeet are exactly alike. Every pair of boots, shoes, and sandals is naturally tanned and processed by hand, allowing for subtle variations in the leather. These variations are highlighted by the way you wear them, giving each pair its own story and helping you to truly be yourself.","Retail Apparel and Fashion","11-50 employees",,"Portsmouth, New Hampshire","United States","duckfeetusa.com","https://www.linkedin.com/company/duckfeet-usa"

,"The Framery","For too long, glasses have been seen as a correction of a physical ailment — a medical necessity. But, they should be so much more than vision correction. Glasses should serve as an outward expression of personality; an extension of style. Visual language. A voice. 

Your ""Lingo"" is the words you use to express yourself. 
Liingo is how you express yourself using your two ""i""s.

Our passion is to enable consumers to use eyewear for self-expression—to make a statement and tell their stories through eyewear. We know that at $270 a pop for glasses, this can't happen. So, we're flipping the model.

 - We carefully curate our selection to make it easy to find the styles that express the depth and breadth of your personality. 

 - We only sell frames made from premium materials, sourced directly from the manufacturer, providing the highest quality at affordable prices. 

 - We don’t sell branded products like Oakley, Ray-Ban and Prada because we believe that self-expression doesn’t need an expensive label.

 - We delight customers with a superior experience, including benefits like a free 60-day return policy.

,"Khana","Khana is on a mission to ensure every girl has the panties she needs to manage menstruation and stay in school—starting with Uganda.

While pads have become more accessible in the developing world, panties have not. Without panties to hold pads in place, over 8 million girls in Sub-Saharan Africa miss up to one week of school every month. Many girls drop out entirely once they start their period.

Can something as simple as a pair of panties keep girls in school? Yes! And the possibilities extend beyond education. Menstrual hygiene interventions enable girls to overcome obstacles to their health and freedom such as child marriage and gender based violence, while increasing their chances of future employment and equal opportunity at large.

Education, employment, equal opportunity—that’s the possibility of just one pair.

How does it work? All Khana panties are ethically made in the country receiving them to create jobs and contribute to economic sustainability. Our panties are then distributed in Days for Girls Uganda kits, which include washable pads, menstruation education, and more! By supporting Khana, you are ensuring every girl has the panties she needs to manage menstruation and stay in school—starting with Uganda.","Retail Apparel and Fashion","11-50 employees","Non Profit","Minneapolis, Minnesota","United States","khanapanties.com","https://www.linkedin.com/company/khana-panties"

Founded by American craftsmen who sought accessible leather goods, Trafalgar designs and manufactures the highest quality men’s leather goods and accessories, using the finest, most distinctive materials from throughout the world. 

The crossbow represents the history and heart of the Trafalgar brand. Mirroring the shape of an infinity sign, the crossbow symbolizes the longevity of the Trafalgar name, its core values, and infinite style. Every product is crafted with care, and a luxurious, timeless aesthetic, making it a smart choice no matter where you're headed.  

The heart of Trafalgar lies within our leathers. 

Though they are treasured, our leather goods are hardly delicate. Each piece is crafted by hand, using uncompromising construction in every stitch. Trafalgar originals are durable and dynamic enough to carry you through every moment in life, which is why men have trusted us generation after generation, to supply dependable luxury accessories.

Today, Trafalgar is part of the Phoenix Leather Goods family of brands, extending its commitment to integrity, honor, and quality to the global community. Trafalgar still stands by its original vision: combining timeless American style and refined haberdashery details for the discerning man.

What makes a denim line unique? Combining an eclectic, worldly, rock n’ roll founder, a chic designer and a team of brilliant artisans.  Using the beau monde in fabric and supplies each pair is handcrafted in trend-setting Scottsdale, Arizona.
 
Chris Kay founded Diego Milano in 2012. Searching for the perfect pair of jeans in Paris, Milan, London and New York City, he struggled to find what he wanted. The fates aligned in SOHO New York one hot August day and connected him to Linda Thithavong, a fashion designer working at Robin’s Jeans. Together, they started their own line with one all consuming mission: to create the perfect pair.
 
Today, Diego Milano stands out in the often-predictable luxury denim market with its combination of rebellious, Rock n Roll edge, incredibly sophisticated construction and utterly unique designs. An exceptionally innovative brand, they surprise us with provocative seams, intricate pleats and washes that have never before been seen on denim. The attention to detail is impeccable. Designed in Italy, the highest quality, incredibly luxurious materials and sensuously sleek hardware are transformed by our designers to create these works of art. The first sketch to the final fitting is a mesmerizing, alluring and magical process.
 
The Diego Milano brand has mastered the art of making one feel special. These exclusive luxurious jeans change how you feel inside. They exude confidence, pleasure, power, and an exceptionally iconic personality. One doesn’t just wear these jeans they experience them.
 

 
Handcrafted, each pair of jeans is made with meticulous care and passion. Alterations and custom modifications are included in your investment. The Diego Milano brand has taken luxury denim to a whole new level.

,"Proud Ninety Golf Co.","Who are we? We’re just a group of guys that love hitting the links. When we go out, breaking 90 is considered a win for the day.  Our approach to the game of golf is similar to our approach to life - always have a good time, and don’t take things too seriously. It’s not just about hitting the lowest score out there. It’s about letting off steam after a hard week at work. It’s about kicking back and having a few beers with your buds while playing a game we love. It’s about getting out there and having a great time on the course, regardless of whether we're shooting in the 80’s or the 100’s. 

At some point, it occurred to us that there was no golf brand for the average weekend hacker just looking to have fun — so we decided it was our duty to create one. And just like that, Proud 90 was born.

We think our fierce bold designs and comfortable, lightweight fabrics serve as a reflection of how we choose to play the game — sometimes unconventional, but never too seriously. Don’t get us wrong! We’re always working on ways to improve our game, same as we're always working on ways to improve our brand. That being said, we know we are never going to be on the PGA Tour but that hasn't stopped us from going for it on every shot, and having a hell of a good time doing it.","Retail Apparel and Fashion","11-50 employees","Privately Held","Boca Raton, Florida","United States","proud90.com","https://www.linkedin.com/company/proud90"

Location is important. So is supporting our community. When starting Peixoto, Mauricio Esquenazi knew he wanted to create employment opportunities in his hometown of Cali, Colombia. Cali became the heart of our business and home to our production factory. There, we have created an environment of skilled workers who are encouraged to share their knowledge and expertise. From the seamstress to the head designer, each employee has a valued voice at Peixoto. We’re proud to say that after ten years in business, most of our team remains the same, advancing their careers and creating a workplace they call home.

We Take Care of Our Own
We strive to create ethical working conditions and relationshipswith every stakeholder in our supply chain. By owning our factoryin Colombia, we are able to ensure a safe and healthy work environment and competitive wages for our employees. Peixoto employee benefits include: Two weeks of paid vacation, health and retirement benefits, subsidized transportation, 40-hourwork week, plus paid overtime and bonuses.

We Foster Diversity & Inclusion
At Peixoto, we believe inclusivity is just good business. We strive to build a brand that promotes body positivity and embraces peopleof all races, genders and body types.

,"Earth Sun Moon","It started quite innocently in the basement of a local record shop in 1996, but over the years Earth Sun Moon Trading Co. has grown into what you might call a successful company. (Which means there are lots of good folks working here and that I actually get a steady paycheck and a decent car to drive.)

Our nature-inspired designs are known for their quirky sense of humor and top-notch artwork, but what many people don't know is that Earth Sun Moon has become much more than just another T-shirt company. It has become a place where each customer and employee is valued and respected, a place that gives back to the community, and a place that puts people above profits.

Maybe you've heard that you can't make money if you're concerned about treating people right. I have to tell you—it's not true! I've discovered that the ordinary, small-town Americans of Grove City, PA are capable of brilliant creativity, staggering productivity and an almost embarrassing loyalty. Giving them the chance to prove it is one of the best reasons I go to work every day.

I've also discovered that people who feel valued are more likely to value others in turn. That's why you can expect to get the best customer service of your life from the great people here at Earth Sun Moon. There is a reason we're an A+ rated member of the Better Business Bureau. It's not our policies (although being organized helps). It's because we care! Our four-fold mission is:

To be good to our customers. 

To be good to each other.

To be good at what we do.

To be good to the earth. It's the only one we've got!

I hope you enjoy our unique apparel as much as we enjoyed creating it! Thank you for your patronage, and thanks for taking the time to get to know us better. I hope you'll be back again soon.

All the best,

For over 25 years we’ve been in the business of helping fraternity and sorority members like you, from all across North America, express their friendship and mutual support by proudly wearing their Greek house letters that were custom printed or twill applique embroidered by us. (See our list of embroidered Greek Fonts.)

It’s unfortunate for us that the phrase “for you by you” is already in use. It would be a perfect fit!

At Something Greek, fraternity and sorority members can order personalized, made-to-order Greek apparel and top-notch, high quality Greek merchandise that is sure to make you stand out.

We don’t just make shirts and sweats; we can custom embroider or print on virtually anything, from phone cases and hats, to flip flops, Greek paddles, and even jewelry; and that’s not all.

When you order fraternity clothing or sorority apparel from Something Greek, Greeks are making your Greek gear!

And just like you, our workers know what it’s like to be in an organization, and we are here and ready to answer all your questions on what will look best, or work best for your Greek fraternity or sorority.

That means we know what you like and what you don’t. If we guarantee a date by which you’ll receive your Greek apparel, you’ll get it on that date, or before. Our 25-year history as a Greek screen-printing and embroidery company working with Greeks ensures that we know a lot about what your Greek organization likes and wants.

As our customer, we also allow you to order in bulk, which gives you the option to save big bucks on our already low prices. No order for fraternity or sorority gear is too big or too small for us; which means no minimums on certain products.

Our online Something Greek clothing store is continually growing in order to keep up with the latest fashionable trends and styles and offer you great Greek gear and gifts.","Apparel and Fashion","11-50 employees","Privately Held","West Hempstead, NY","United States","somethinggreek.com","https://www.linkedin.com/company/something-greek"

,"Hadley Pollet","Hadley Pollet is a contemporary American brand known for creating classic, timeless designs that inspire kind, powerful women to shine strong. The line includes handbags, belts, one-of-a-kind jewelry designs, athletic wear and apparel.

Hadley’s original signature belt designs sprung from inspiration while at RISD. Her unique style caught the eyes of many when she wore a belt made of vintage ribbon and a tortoise buckle to a birthday party in Boston where several people asked where she got her belt. And with the blink of an eye, she started her business and never looked back. Since then, her line has expanded into a lifestyle brand for high-spirited, powerful women. 

Her inspiration for not only her business, but also her business's purpose came after 9/11. Hadley felt propelled to channel the chaos going on politically, economically, and socially into something positive and uplifting. In January 2002, after several years of working in marketing and public relations for textile and fashion companies, Hadley Pollet launched her own line of belts made with copyrighted textiles that conveyed hope and happiness. 

Hadley’s intent since day one has always been to inspire women to radiate the power of kindness despite the ongoing negativity in our world. The brand represents self-expression, empowerment, and confidence by igniting an emotional desire for women to feel spiritually uplifted when dressing. Each piece in the line is intended to “exude an outfit” while propelling women to express their individuality, wholeheartedly. Her hope is that every day, women wake up and dress as their spiritual selves, shining brightly for all the world to enjoy. 

This translates into Hadley visiting every factory and artisan who works with the company, not only to make sure their business practices are ethical and fair, but also that the women are paid fairly.  It is a fact that if women are empowered economically, then the local society as a whole strengthens.","Retail Apparel and Fashion","11-50 employees","Partnership","New York, New York","United States","hadleypollet.com","https://www.linkedin.com/company/hadley-pollet"

A Family Approach
Watching the decades and their cultural and sartorial changes swirl by, we’ve grown accustomed to making hats that blend vintage feel with modern sensibilities.

Worldly Touch

Whether aiming for a vintage look or a casual day at the ballpark, a well worn hat can help make an outfit anything but ordinary. With manufacturing facilities in the U.S., Canada, Asia, Mexico, and Europe, you can be sure that your Tenth Street purchase combines a worldly touch, matched with local character.

,"Buxton Leather","In the late 1800’s, Dana Buxton had built a small successful company distributing small notions. He was always trying out new business ideas and his most profitable one  actually began with a small invention his wife designed. Dana lost his keys one day through a hole in his pants pocket. Julia decided that to prevent such a loss again she would make him a small leather pouch that would hold his keys. Due to the popularity of that small leather item a new business was born. Buxton Company was formally organized in 1898.

In the early 1900’s, Buxton became a highly respected leather goods manufacturer recognized for their quality leather goods. Top rated leathers and skilled craftsmanship were synonymous with the Buxton name.

The Dopp brand was purchased in 1979. This gave the company another outlet for their personal leather goods line. Dopp was also known for their fine quality leathers and durable constructions and had been successful with it’s Dopp kits. This was a great match and allowed the company to serve the consumer with choice accessories for their personal needs.
 
Buxton’s commitment to fine craftsmanship continues today and will continue for the next one hundred and ten years.","Retail Apparel and Fashion","11-50 employees","Privately Held","Springfield, MA","United States","buxtonstyle.com","https://www.linkedin.com/company/buxton-leather"

The Cigar Bibs allow you to “#protectthethreads” from the surprise of unexpected hot ashes falling on you while smoking cigars or anything else, which often occurs while distracted conversing or entertaining others.  These handmade semi-custom Cigar Bibs give you peace of mind so you can relax and thoroughly enjoy your smoke without worrying about hot ashes damaging your skin, clothing, furniture, vehicle interior, or any other valuable and possibly irreplaceable personal items.  

The goal and design of this luxury accessory was to create an elegant talking piece that not only protects your investments (i.e. clothing, cars, furniture, etc.), but also serves as a fashion accessory statement piece that expresses your personality. 

Our tagline is “Expressive accessories for living boldly”.

Discovered from a problem-solving idea of mine, Alphonso Brown, BSCH (BS Chemistry), an avid cigar smoker, to prevent the damage caused by the “Ash Accident” which is the unexpected falling of hot or cold ashes onto your lap or shirt. The Cigar Bibs have evolved into a complete fire-retardant patent pending product capable of withstanding hot burning ashes. 

WHERE TO USE:
The Cigar Bibs come with a drawstring tote bag so you can transport them to be used anywhere you desire to smoke, including any smoking-friendly environment, your home,  patio or balcony, your vehicle, and even while on vacation. 

FOR ALL CIGAR OR ANY SMOKERS:
The Cigar Bibs were developed for men and women to protect their skin, clothing, furniture, vehicle interior, or any other valuable personal items from the damage caused by hot or cold ashes during smoking while making an expressive bold stylish statement.","Retail Apparel and Fashion","11-50 employees","Privately Held","Miami, FL","United States","lujoandco.com","https://www.linkedin.com/company/lujo-co-inc"

,"Mobile Warming Technology by Fieldsheer","Fieldsheer is unlike any other heated apparel company - because we’re not an apparel company. We are a technology company. Our Mobile Warming line is a technology platform, the only heated apparel company in the U.S. market that owns our full supply chain, from hardware R&D, battery design, to cut-and-sew, and app development. This means Fieldsheer and our Mobile Warming line have the ability to bring higher quality products to market faster than the competition, ensuring we continue to lead the pack of integrated digital apparel.

Our heated panels in our Mobile Warming garments are the thinnest and least cumbersome in the market. Since we designed the battery hardware from the ground-up, it also means they are optimally efficient. Paired with our Bluetooth connected app, we further optimize the functionality of our heated apparel to be warmer, last longer, and manage wearer climate on a micro scale. 

It doesn’t stop with Mobile Warming. Fieldsheer is exploring the integration of digital sensors, algorithm optimized power supply and the promise of connected devices to redefine what we come to expect from the apparel we wear. We envision a future where smart apparel provides a suite of benefits - from on-demand heating and cooling, to health monitoring, and even haptic extensions to interpret a wider range of information in our digital world, like navigational directions and advanced warnings about our environment.

Fieldsheer is leading the digital revolution of a human technology -- apparel -- that has remained fundamentally unchanged for thousands of years.","Retail Apparel and Fashion","11-50 employees","Privately Held","San Marcos, California","United States","mobilewarming.com","https://www.linkedin.com/company/mobile-warming"

Our Story:
In 2017, at the young age of 15, Eli, alongside his 18-year-old brother Spencer, embarked on a mission to redefine fashion.

Born from the desire to make a real difference in the world, Habits 365 is the brand that represents this vision.

Our Philosophy:
Habits 365 believes that every day is an opportunity to cultivate positive habits and to make choices that shape our future. Our fashion is a statement about who we are now, and who we wish to become. It's about wearing our aspirations and embodying the changes we wish to see in ourselves.

Our Commitment:
We are committed to serving as a source of inspiration and a catalyst for change. Through our vibrant designs, we strive to promote a message of positivity, self-improvement, and resilience. Every piece in our various collections is designed with the intention of empowering you to embrace your unique journey and celebrate your personal growth.

Join Our Movement:
Habits 365 invites you to be part of a movement that believes in the power of habits to transform lives. Our fashion is for those who dare to dream, for those who strive for better, and for those who recognize that every day represents a step towards you becoming your best self.

,"Jen Kao","Embracing a cerebral approach to her design process, Jen Kao's collection is driven by the sartorial mementos in life. Drawing upon her inherent knowledge of the modern woman, Kao continues to reinterpret classics for the progressive and self-aware.

Since the launch of her label in 2007, Kao has established herself as a designer that blends antonymous ideas to alter perceptions of the expected. She uses minimalist and maximalist concepts; detailed geometric prints are cut in clean silhouettes, while tech fabrics are redefined through both precise tailoring and fluid draping. Through fabric manipulation and experimentation, her collection continually inspires others to abandon their visual preconceptions.

Born in Los Angeles and raised in Kansas, Kao moved to New York City in 1999 to study Studio Art at NYU where she focused on a diversity of mediums including ceramic sculpture, mixed-media, and writing. This foundation in three-dimensional design led to a growing passion for garment construction, which Kao later pursued through a post-graduate program at Parsons School of Design.

Kao has been the recipient of various honors including the Vogue Talents Corner in 2011, and both the Harvard Leadership in the Arts Award and the Stacy Nipps Alumni Award from Parsons in 2012. In 2011, the designer was inducted into the CFDA.","Retail Apparel and Fashion","11-50 employees","Privately Held","New York, NY","United States","jenkao.com","https://www.linkedin.com/company/jen-kao"

One T-shirt, one pair of pants, one pair of shoes for thousands upon thousands of people. Things have gotten better today, and there are more niche brands that cater to unique interests such as skaters, basketball players, bikers, rock stars, etc… But still fashion is a top-down process, where fashion is ultimately dictated by the few and imposed on the masses.

We are creating tools that will allow everyone to participate in how fashion is conceived, and we want to give everyone the tools to buy and wear fashion that caters to their unique tastes.

By controlling the entire production process, Vicci is able to ensure that each pair of eyeglasses meets the highest standards of quality and craftsmanship. This approach also allows the company to offer customers a wider range of options when it comes to frame styles, colors, and materials.

In addition to its focus on product quality and innovation, Vicci Eyewear is also dedicated to providing an exceptional customer experience. The company understands that ordering prescription eyewear online can be a daunting prospect for some customers, which is why it has invested heavily in creating a user-friendly online platform that guides customers through the process step-by-step. Whether you're a seasoned eyewear buyer or a first-time customer, Vicci makes it easy to find the perfect pair of glasses from the comfort of your own home.

One of the ways that Vicci Eyewear achieves this is through its commitment to transparency and education. The company provides detailed information about each frame and lens option, as well as tips and advice on how to choose the right pair of glasses for your needs. This approach helps to demystify the process of ordering prescription eyewear online and gives customers the confidence they need to make informed decisions about their purchases.","Retail Apparel and Fashion","11-50 employees","Partnership","Miami, FL","United States","viccieyewear.com","https://www.linkedin.com/company/vicci-eyewear"

In addition to spending time on the pitch, the field, the track, and the road, we’ve spent a lot of time micro-measuring competitive athletes’ performance results, dissecting improvements down to the geekiest equations.

What we’ve discovered is that there’s serious competitive edge that can’t be shrugged, sprinted, lifted, slammed, or spun into being.

This edge is called Precovery. Pro-trainers have long known downtime is important for muscle rebuilding, but most amateur athletes haven’t had access to the kinds of information, products and equipment that boost this critical process to the next level.

And who has the room in their home or their schedule for ice-baths and cryotherapy chambers?

Winning, breaking through, and beating your PB isn’t about giving more time to training. It’s about using the time between workouts (and performances) to help the muscles rebuild stronger, faster.

What makes Timeless Tartans unique is our innovative method for creating the custom tartan designs that adorn each licensed item.

What emerges from this process is a distinctive tartan pattern that represents the school’s history and character without the overt use of logos or trademarks. Our design approach applies the principle of unaided brand awareness; a proven method to further elevate brand equity. The result is a more subtle, sophisticated way for alumni, students, faculty, and staff to wear their school pride in any professional or social setting. 


Our core products consist of Italian-made: socks, silk ties/scarves, and a new line of tartan-trimmed leather accessories. We have also recently launched a line of luxurious, heirloom-quality products featuring our ""Iconic Image"" blankets.

,"Evy's Tree","Evy’s Tree came into my life is completely by accident; definitely what I would consider a God thing. When I decided to stay home with Jacob, money was VERY tight. In October of 2009, I was inspired by many wonderful and creative stay at home moms who could whip up these beautiful items for their families with practically no money. I felt like I couldn’t even take my kids’ hems up if I needed to, and that made me feel very inadequate as a mom for some strange reason. It seemed like everyone I knew could sew. So I borrowed my mom’s sewing machine and attempted to learn. In fact, I did a big post on my family blog regarding my feelings about being crafty right after I brought the machine home. The post is a bit of a joke now as I complained how I wasn’t creative, and yet here I am- creating for a living! You can read about that here.

Anyway, I started sewing a little for myself and then I took on the task, with help from some do it yourself blogs, of embellishing some hoodies from my closet for a trip to Disney World that my family was taking in December. I made a handful of hoodies and got gobs and gobs of compliments while in Florida. I posted some pictures of the hoodies on my family blog and almost immediately I started receiving emails from people asking if they could purchase one. A couple of weeks later I put up a Paypal link on my blog and sold 15 in 30 minutes. And my business was born…today we no longer make our items by hand, but mass produce luxury pieces from high end fabrics that we have found from all over the world. Our hoodies have been featured on popular sites such as The Weigands and Tori Spelling, and yearly we sell thousands upon thousands of hoodies across the world to teenagers, college goers, career women, moms and even grandmothers! Evy’s Tree is definitely well-loved around the globe.

,"Art-Craft Optical","Our founder, Charles J. Eagle, was originally a Swiss tool maker and his total focus became the production of only the finest quality frames for the eye wear industry. From our Rochester, NY manufacturing base, and throughout the decades, the company’s leadership as the industry standard has endured and is most evident in the tens of millions of frames produced by the company’s skilled employees. Now, as the third generation of the Eagle family leads the company, it continues to evolve in an ever-changing landscape of customer demand, well into the next hundred years.

Our dedication to quality started in the earliest years of gold-filled classic metals, pince-nez and full frame construction, on through the eras of metal and zyl combination frames. Then production grew into all aluminum frames, acetate and metal trim acetate, to then developing fashionable RX safety frames in the nineties, and through it all, our rich tradition of quality always stayed true. We simultaneously answered the call to supply frame products to our Armed Forces in WWI, WWII, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, the Gulf War and all current conflicts. And when the demand for exceptional strength and dependability to withstand the in-cockpit environments of high G tolerance in our supersonic fighter aircraft, ArtCraft was called on to design and manufacture their top of the line eyewear.

How have we maintained our “American Made” expertise? As outsourcing components and manufacturing functions displaced the vast majority of legitimate US frame manufactures, ArtCraft has always invested in expanding its own in house capabilities. That lead us to installing the finest 3D eyewire machines, electrophoretic coating tanks and drying ovens. To keep up with growing fulfillment, computerized bar-code packaging and electronic assembly devices all added to preserving the production of our classic eye wear.","Apparel and Fashion","11-50 employees","Privately Held","Rochester, New York","United States","artcraftoptical.com","https://www.linkedin.com/company/artcraft-optical"

,"Buffalo Outdoors Workwear","A Hardworking Heritage.

Created in Buffalo by Buffalonians, hard work is in our DNA. As a member of the ""Rust Belt"" and historically a manufacturing town, a majority of Buffalo's post-depression population was made up of steelworkers, shipbuilders, dock workers, and many other blue-collar professions. Combined with our somewhat ""unpredictable"" weather, it made for a pretty tough place to live and work, especially through the winter months.

After the war, Buffalo began to see a decline in it's population. But recently we have seen a major resurgence in the city. We feel that Buffalo Outdoors is going through a bit of a resurgence as well. We have been working hard to improve and build upon our foundation by increasing the quality of our workwear without impacting the affordability of it. We know you work hard, and we know that your clothes take a beating. So why would you spend $100 on a jacket? This is our mission at Buffalo Outdoors.

We always have and always will continue to put you, the customer, first.","Retail Apparel and Fashion","11-50 employees","Privately Held","Lackawanna, NY","United States","buffalooutdoorsclothing.com","https://www.linkedin.com/company/buffalo-outdoors-workwear"

,"Bootights","Built on the mission to provide hosiery that truly merges comfort and style, Bootights is the industry’s first performance moisture-wicking sock and premium tights—all in one. 

Shelby Mason established Socktights (formerly Bootights) to meet a deep-rooted, untapped need in the lives of everyday women. Shelby, like most women she met, was tired of the woes of wearing boots with tights that led to blisters on the feet and snags in the hosiery. After years of makeshift solutions, like wearing “borrowed” men’s tube socks over tights, her vision came to life.

Socktights (originally called Bootights) was born in 2011, with two industry-first legwear products that launched at Dillard’s: ankle and mid-calf socks attached to premium tights. The company soon expanded into other leading department stores, with its keystone Socktights—offering the hosiery in a variety of classic colors and motifs.

Socktights’ innovation lies in it patent-pending methodology, which allows for the ultimate in performance socks—featuring moisture-wicking fibers; compression arch support; a mesh zone; cushioning in the toe and heel; and a flat toe seam. Further, Socktights’ “tightology” offers every-course knit for a smoother feel and increased durability; moderate control for the stomach; and a widened waistband to ensure it does not roll or dig into the waist. 

Throughout the years, Socktights has evolved to offer an ever-growing collection of functional, fashion-forward socks and tights—continuing to uphold its dedication to addressing the evolving needs of everyday, active women.

Today, the Socktights brand offers legwear options in a plethora of prints, styles, and materials to accommodate a diverse range of shoes - from Socktights to Invisi-liners to KNEEhi Socks and beyond. 

The company’s original commitment stands strong—to provide innovative legwear solutions women can trust, without sacrificing on comfort or style.","Retail Apparel and Fashion","11-50 employees","Self Owned","New York, NY","United States","bootights.com","https://www.linkedin.com/company/socktights"

,"HEX | Equip The Creators","Music originally brought founders Dan Maravilla and Trent Valladares together as teenagers living in late 1980's Southern California. Musicians and band-mates they perfected their craft working their way up the local club scene in Los Angeles. Their music style was eclectic, mixing alternative, jazz, funk, fusion, soul, and rock - always seeking to create what was not the norm. Even at that young age their creativity did not stop with sound. Both talented visual artists, they would outfit concerts into total sensory experiences by creating and performing original music as well as transforming prestigious concert venues with all-encompassing art installations - to provide a total experience. Clothing and fashion were also on the boy's radar often repurposing and making their own clothing and accessories.

After years in the music and art scene, they decided to launch a small, startup, family business. Their focus was accessories; headwear, watches, small leather goods, backpacks, and knitwear. Early collections gained attention from many world-renowned brands and they started designing and manufacturing for established labels. This provided valuable opportunities to see inside many great companies and eventually give them the knowledge to be able to launch their own successful brands, which they did, and currently these products can be found in boutiques and major store chains around the world today.

In 2010, some twenty-plus-years since Dan and Trent’s first humble steps into fashion, HEX was launched. HEX draws on their decades of experience in fashion and channels it in an innovative new direction. At its core, it fuses their eye for style with their love of technology. HEX was created with a new viewpoint - looking at fashion and technology as equally necessary and inspiring.

As students across campus showed up to career fairs in off-the-rack, ill-fitting suits, Adam stood apart from them all in his one-of-a-kind suit, receiving compliments and striking up conversation with prospective employers. He knew then that he wanted to find a way to provide custom apparel, especially suiting, to anyone from college and high school students to CEOs.  

Tailor On Tap was then founded under the principle to help our clients achieve a look that is as individual as they are. We are here as your personal stylist to help set your style apart from others and create the first impression that lasts. We have sourced thousands of fabrics from around the world, so the possibilities for creating your unique look are endless. From three-piece suits to custom shirts, from dresses to denim, we are available to guide you through the process to create that one-of-a-kind ensemble.

,"Helen Jon","At Helen Jon, we believe that swimsuits should be as flattering, comfortable and chic as your favorite little black dress - and they should make you feel just as confident and beautiful, too. That's why our swimsuits, clothing and activewear are all focused on making you feel comfortable in your own skin first, whether you're practicing yoga on the beach, chasing little ones through the surf, or soaking up some sun in paradise.

It all started in 2012 with our founders, Gwyn Prentice and Missy Neville. For years, they'd found something missing in the swimwear world: Why couldn't companies create sophisticated and flattering designs that offer more comfort for women? After all, many beautiful suits don't have the support or coverage of a good fit - and many of the sturdier, more comfortable suits don't have elegant, fashion-able designs. Why couldn't women have it all, in one swimsuit line? 

That's how Helen Jon was created.

Now, we make our pieces with the luxurious fabrics, flattering silhouettes, and expert craftsmanship that goes into the best designer clothing lines. We start with the highest quality fabrics that are smooth to the touch and flattering on the frame, and focus on fit above all else.

That's why we have up to seven fittings for each look before they ever go to the production line, when most brands only have three. It's just one way that we make sure every last detail reflects our care and craft. And it's how we make sure that each Helen Jon product will keep our customers reaching for it in their suitcase for years to come.","Retail Apparel and Fashion","11-50 employees","Privately Held","Lenexa, Kansas","United States","helenjon.com","https://www.linkedin.com/company/helen-jon"

,"Three Bird Nest","LIKE ALL THINGS WE LOVE, THREE BIRD NEST WAS BORN FROM A WHIM, NURTURED BY PASSION, AND GREW FROM THE UNEXPECTED, UNPREDICTABLE TWISTS THAT LIFE HAS GIFTED US ALONG THE WAY.
 
In November 2011, we started out as a one-woman shop when @aliciashaffer discovered a love for making bohemian-inspired headbands and accessories. At the time, Alicia was running her own women’s clothing shop, and seeing Three Bird Nest’s store bloom with orders for her handmade wears was both exhilarating and terrifying—there were moments she wasn’t sure if her hands could possibly keep up! 

But the amazing thing about sharing your creations with others is you connect with fellow kindred spirits. You see the things that bring you warmth and smiles reflected in the glow of others who are thrilled to have found a shop that gets them.

Within a year, we’d begun offering a full collection of accessories. Our staff expanded to a cozy twelve (hence the “we”) and our shop evolved to include leather jewelry, clothing, purses and boho gems designed here in our California studio, in addition to treasured finds from all over the world that we simply can’t keep to ourselves.

And because our greatest inspiration is listening to what you love, we continue growing. Our clothing collections are curated from all over the world, designed to complement our accessories. Think warm knits, pretty laces, things that sparkle, and a touch of leather. Think patterns and textures you’d expect would clash but instead mesh perfectly. Our style is a bit like a river carving its way through the earth; even when we touch upon a trend, we carry it somewhere new. We create for the woman that’ll make our styles her own. For the woman who wants to make a statement without saying a word.

In 2014, two friends found themselves looking up at an elephant and something clicked. They understood why elephants had been revered for thousands of years and why so many people traveled far and wide to see them.

Marie Oliver was founded in 2015 by Creative Director Sarah Doggett Evenson, who first pursued a successful career in finance before her creativity and entrepreneurial spirit won out. Combining her middle name, “Marie,” with her husband Peter’s middle name, “Oliver,” the eponymous product offering quickly grew from several signature core styles to a wide range of versatile pieces that fill a wardrobe year-round.

Aptly for a company operated by a wife and husband, it’s the energizing tension of opposites that fuels the fashion perspective of Marie Oliver. Grounded in the exceptional outcomes of contradiction and compromise, our pieces reflect plays of soft paired with hard, voluminous shapes finished with tailored details, neutrals punctuated by pops of neon, and laid back southern ease with aspirational edge. The result? Seasonal collections crafted for everyday born from the vivid imagining of what can be out of the ordinary. 

We remain independently owned and operated, and are proudly based in North Carolina. Sarah lives in Greensboro with her husband, son, and rescue dog.

,"Martin Dingman","Over 50 years ago, when Martin was a boy, the Martin Dingman
Countrywear heritage began. Born in Iowa, raised in Southern
Missouri, summers were spent on horseback working the family's
herd of Black Angus cattle. Much of the time he enjoyed helping
Grandfather Nickell, who passed on the value of an honest
handshake and a deep appreciation of country living. The textures
and colors of old barns, alfalfa fields, and a tack room full of
handcrafted saddles permanently imprinted the marrow of his
bones and the retina of his eyes. Since 1983, these boyhood
memories have tremendously influenced his timeless collections.

Martin is steadfast in his dedication to quality and authenticity,
which are revealed throughout his apparel and leathergoods
collections. Every piece tells a unique story of heritage, quality,
and the “Refined Country Life”. If creating the finest means selling
less, then Martin's ultimate goal is to create one piece so fine,
that when the man who originally owned it has finally gone, his
son can merely hold it and feel his father's presence.

Martin Dingman Countrywear is coveted by men of integrity,
uncompromising principles, and men who embrace sophisticated
country style. Each collection celebrates gentlemen who enjoy
nothing more than the sound of a line perfectly cast over a
babbling brook, the smell of spent shotgun shells, or the thrill of
a flushed covey.","Retail Apparel and Fashion","11-50 employees","Privately Held","Lead Hill, Arkansas","United States","martindingman.com","https://www.linkedin.com/company/martin-dingman-leathergoods"

,"Fieldsheer","Since 1978 Fieldsheer has redefined what clothing can do.

We design for what’s unseen, around the bend in the road. It was true when Fieldsheer was the first to design motorcycle jackets with integrated protective pads. It was true when Fieldsheer was the first to introduce heated motorcycle apparel for chilly rides in unpredictable conditions. It remains true as we focus on developing the next generation of apparel technologies for work and play.

Carrying the torch of our heritage of innovation is what drives us to ride further, work harder, brave the elements, and do more with what we wear.

To deliver on that promise, Fieldsheer has recently re-focused our product lines to facilitate nimble focus, technological collaboration and market clarity. We invite you to explore our new and mature brands under the Fieldsheer umbrella:

Mobile Warming - cutting edge, battery heated apparel for work and play, managed with your phone
Mobile Cooling - Advanced apparel evolved from our motorcycle technologies to keep people cool in hot environments, or when wearing protective outerwear
RiderWear - Reinvention of our flagship motorcycle riding apparel that builds on our first innovation from 1978 in integrated protective padding

Fieldsheer is unlike any other heated apparel company - because we’re not an apparel company. We are a technology company. Our Mobile Warming line is a technology platform, the only heated apparel company in the U.S. market that owns our full supply chain, from hardware R&D, battery design, to cut-and-sew, and app development. This means Fieldsheer and our Mobile Warming line have the ability to bring higher quality products to market faster than the competition, ensuring we continue to lead the pack of integrated digital apparel.","Retail Apparel and Fashion","11-50 employees","Public Company","San Marcos, California","United States","fieldsheer.com","https://www.linkedin.com/company/fieldsheer"

Along the way, Ink learned that making great shirts is about much more than spreading ink on cotton. You can't make great shirts without great people, so they focus first on developing the best consultants, designers, and print-makers.

Since 1988, CEO Holt Condren has led Ink Custom Tees on its journey to becoming one of America’s top t-shirt screen printing companies. In 1993, current President Scott Masters joined Holt as an owner, and their complimentary leadership styles have proved a successful match. With Holt’s vision and Scott’s execution, they have worked hard to build this company according to the “Ink Way Values”.

Today, you'll find Ink Custom Tees just outside Little Rock, Arkansas, better than ever. Along with their strong staff, both men work hard to lead Ink according to the values that define them. Ink has built more than a business - they've built a family and a culture.

A Modern Jeweler
Four generations of expertise in the diamond and jewelry industry shapes our new eCommerce approach to offering quality jewelry at quality prices. Innovative tools like our Customization, Digital Layaways, Concierge & Virtual TryItOn sets us apart. 

For The Modern Couple
Couples today are dating longer, living together, and may decide to start a family before a wedding can be prioritized in their lives. They are also looking for something different - an opportunity to celebrate a timeless tradition, but with a practical & affordable option that’s aligned with their values. 

Trio Wedding Rings
Modern couples are searching for a style which expresses their identity as a union rather than their individual tastes. Matching Trio Wedding Rings pair the Ladies’ engagement ring, Ladies’ band and a matching Mens‘ band into The Perfect Match. Trio Wedding Ring sets also save couples time & money. A wedding ring shows you’re married, but a matching ring shows who you married!

Authentic & Affordable Quality
For decades, the jewelry industry has relied on excessive branding markups and pricing games that cause inefficiencies and inflated prices. It’s no wonder couples don’t have a jeweler they can trust. Drawing on four generations of expertise in this industry, we’ve reduced inefficiencies by working with the very crafters of main street jewelry to provide quality bridal jewelry with only real Conflict-Free Diamonds, direct to hardworking couples.

,"Shop Stevie","Hi Guys!

My name is Stevie Henderson, and a few years ago I started a fashion blog. As I searched for clothing pieces to share with my followers, I found it hard to find items that were both my style and something I loved. My husband and I decided to start a small online store, and we attached it to my blog. I've always had a love for fashion and a love for helping people feel good about themselves, and I found a way to combine the two through my store. Both blogging and picking out clothes for people were ways that I could help them feel comfortable and good about themselves, as well as be up-to-date with trends. I want every piece in my store to represent me as a person and represent the standards I strive to live up to, so I pick my designs very carefully.

I hope that every woman wearing my pieces, young or old, will feel beautiful and confident about herself! There's more to clothing than just putting something on--it's about how it makes us feel when we're wearing it, and how we want to represent ourselves as a person.

I owe so much to my husband, Trevor, who helped me start Shop Stevie. He is just as much a part of this as I am, and has made a dream come true that I never thought I could have achieved. Shop Stevie started with me and Trev, but is now so much more. Shop Stevie wouldn't be what it is without my team behind me. They are all very talented at what they do and I feel so blessed to be able to grow and learn from them.

And of course, I have an amazing support system through my customers! They are the most loyal customers and so caring. I love seeing some of my long-time customers at events or catching up with them through social media--they really feel like family! I love getting to know my Shop Stevie girls out there! :) Love you all and thank you for shopping and for all of your support.

,"West Coast Shoe Company (Wescoboots.com)","West Coast Shoe Company has been manufacturing boots and shoes for 105 years, having been held in the Shoemaker family for four generations. Founded by John Henry Shoemaker in 1918, it’s a company built on heritage and sweat. Each boot is built using a 155-step process. 

West Coast Shoe Company, commonly known as Wesco, still manufactures all its boots in the United States, made from American materials. Wesco is especially known for making work boots worn by linemen, loggers, wild land firefighters, motorcyclists, and other rugged outdoor use but also creates fashion dress footwear custom built for men and women.

Based in the small town of Scappoose, Oregon - Wesco found it’s beginning in Portland, Oregon and rapidly grew into multiple locations in the downtown  area from 1918 to 1931, before moving to Scappoose, Oregon.  An 8,000-square foot factory was built on the hill over Scappoose and over the next 86 years the company would continue to grow to its current size of 16,000 sq. ft. employing nearly 40+ full-time craftsmen and women.  Wesco boots are marketed direct from the factory and through approximately 250 dealers across the U.S. and through distributors worldwide.  Approximately one-third of the production of this Authentically American made product is exported to countries outside the U.S.  Wesco has a large following of customers in Asian countries like Japan.

Wesco has always offered customization to the individual and has added a modern marketing feature on it’s website to allow customers to design their own boots on-line with a Custom Boot Builder.  But beware, it can be indicatively fun creating your own ‘one of a kind’ pair of boots.

Wesco is located at 52828 NW Shoe Factory Lane in Scappoose, Oregon.  The office and factory showroom is open Monday through Friday 7:30a to 4:00p. Tours and after-hours fittings are available by appointment.

,"Sportif USA, Inc.","In 1965, Sportif began as a small business in southern California, headed by John G. Kirsch. In true entrepreneurial style, Kirsch sold tennis shorts from the back of the family's station wagon, gradually building a reputation for quality and comfort. As this reputation grew, so did the market for high-quality outdoor clothing.

Tennis shorts led to hiking, which led to fishing and nautical apparel…and so the Sportif brand took shape. By 1968, Sportif had developed the first stretch fabric in the outdoor/boating industry, and its Original 6-Pocket Stretch Shorts were becoming a staple for outdoorsmen nationwide.

In the early 70’s, John moved with his wife and children to the Sierra Nevadas, where his blossoming manufacturing business took root.

For the next two decades, Sportif would continue to be an innovator in the outdoor clothing industry, as one of the first companies to utilize Gore-Tex and sun-protective fabrics. In the world of private label contracting, Sportif established itself as a premier manufacturer for companies like Eddie Bauer, L.L. Bean, and others.

In a cruel twist of fate, John Kirsch’s twin-engine Beechcraft plane crashed in the snow-covered San Bernardino Mountains in March 1991. John Kirsch, Jr. boldly took the reigns as President, and with his siblings, decided to continue the dream his father had spent his life pursuing – to position Sportif as a leader in the outdoor apparel industry.

The Kirsch family was able to dramatically alter the nature of Sportif’s business, shifting it away from private label manufacturing and towards a bright independent future.

2005 marked the company’s 40th Anniversary, an event celebrated with exciting new opportunities and adventures. Most notably, Sportif announced the launch of its new women’s line, Aventura Clothing, blending everyday adventures with everyday clothing.

Both Aventura and Sportif continue the 40-year legacy of quality, style, and function that Sportif has established.","Apparel and Fashion","11-50 employees","Privately Held","Sparks, Nevada","United States","sportif.com","https://www.linkedin.com/company/sportif-usa-inc-"

One thing that remained consistent in all swimsuit brands, no matter the quality and price point is that the removable bra inserts that came with them were truly horrendous.

Frustrated with her very own inserts, Angela decided she would figure it out all the way.

These gems fit inside sports bras, swimsuits, camisoles, dresses, tops and regular bras.

,"Christopher Mobley","Lawrenceburg, Tennessee, 1952. This is where the Christopher Mobley story began. 

From Lawrenceburg, CD Mobley and Chris Mobley Sr. migrated to Fulton, Mississippi, then Tupelo, before finally ending up on University Boulevard in Tuscaloosa, Alabama where he opened The Varsity Shop in 1971. The Varsity Shop sold the highest-end retail products that Tuscaloosa had to offer at the time. Seeing a strong demand from residents north of the river, Chris Mobley Sr. moved his store in 1985 to The Tuscaloosa Galleria and rebranded the store as Mobley & Sons. From that moment forward, Mobley & Sons went on to become the premier luxury-clothing store of West Alabama.

Fast-forward 51 years later. CD Mobleys grandson and Chris Mobley Sr's son, Christopher, is now in the family business. With the advances in technology and the influence of performance fabrics, both father and son decided it was time to expand once again.

In August of 2019, the Mobley family returned back to where it all started, University Boulevard, only this time, in a much different style. Mobley & Sons opened a new store designed for the modern-day entrepreneur, golf enthusiast, and athleisure fanatic. In order to connect the two stores but promote different styles, the new store was named Christopher Mobley. Identifying the new venture is a logo that features the letter M and the Roman numeral 3, which represents the three generations of the Mobley family that have been in the retail clothing business.

As times change, the launch of the new store proved that the Mobley family seizes opportunities to grow and learn. The Christopher Mobley store was open just six months before the pandemic hit in March of 2020. Through the strong relationships and loyal customers that the Mobley family fostered over the years, Christopher Mobley continued to thrive. In December of 2022, they opened a new store in Athens, Georgia, marking another exciting chapter fueled by their relationships and loyal customers.","Retail Apparel and Fashion","11-50 employees","Self Employed","Tuscaloosa, Alabama","United States","christophermobley.shop","https://www.linkedin.com/company/christopher-mobley"

,"Stella Valle [We're Hiring]","We started Stella Valle in 2009 after graduating from West Point and serving in the military. As much as we were capable of getting our hands dirty in the Army, we had a passion for fashion and design and were determined to follow our dreams.
 
The genesis for our unique charm jewelry came when Ashley gifted Paige an outdated charm bracelet for graduation from West Point. While Paige was grateful for the gift, the piece and the style didn’t resonate with her. At that point, we knew we needed to create more stylish charm jewelry for young women. We set out to revolutionize outdated charm jewelry, keeping the meaning and personalization, while updating the style, and incorporating inspiration. Our Charm Jewelry Reimagined pieces are simple, yet meaningful and inspirational, and are designed to be stacked and layered as a reminder of the things that inspire you to follow your dreams every day!
 
We're inspired by you, the dreamers, the hustlers, the go-getters, the stylish, and the fashionable, and our designs embody this. We strongly believe women are incredibly strong and dynamic and we live our best lives when we are doing what we love - and look good and feel good doing it. We created Stella Valle to give women the inspiration and confidence to do anything they dream, just as we followed our dreams to be designers despite our military backgrounds.

,"Be Iconic Style: Your Life–Transformed","Bobbi Schwartz, Founder and CEO of The Bobbi Schwartz Group and Be Iconic Style, has been teaching women to dress in a way that accelerates and scales their careers and businesses for decades. 
 
We are all assessed on eight different levels in less than the blink of the eye: two of those levels are capability and dependability. Once that assessment is made, we are either deemed “capable and dependable” or summarily dismissed—all based on our appearance. Lost opportunities compound, and we find ourselves losing confidence, bumping into the “glass ceiling,” and not moving forward in our careers.

The following information is life-changing and results from what Bobbi has learned from decades of working as a personal stylist. How we “show up” in terms of our attire is critical—and there is a simple formula to make that happen. We all have the ability to change our lives and careers by simply changing our attire, and Bobbi has seen, firsthand, the difference that a power wardrobe makes. It builds confidence and creates a power shield that takes a woman where she wants to go—and beyond.

Even now, when most business meetings are conducted via video conferencing, we must step up and dress for the career we want. In a video situation, our sphere of influence is narrowed down to a camera. How we “present” is critical to our career growth as there are fewer opportunities to connect face-to-face with clients, bosses, peers—all the people we want to impact—so every chance we have to make a good impression is multiplied in terms of value. That said, the better prepared we are for a meeting (in terms of knowing what to wear), the more confidence we have, and the better prepared we are to “wow” our colleagues and change the trajectory of our careers.","Retail Apparel and Fashion","11-50 employees","Self Owned","Dallas, TX","United States","beiconicstyle.com","https://www.linkedin.com/company/beiconicstyle"
,"LAND Leather","LAND Leather was founded in 1969 by three adventurous young entrepreneurs. Their thirst for international adventure and love of leather led them to Belen, Colombia, South America. It wash here high in the Andes mountains, one of the world's major cattle producing regions, where the first products were made and tested, and a philosophy was developed: ""Make an identifiable product in the softest, most durable leather and you will develop a loyal following of quality conscious customers"". Since the largest Colombian tanners were only interested in producing industrial grade leather, it was necessary to go to the countryside where rural artisans tanned leather. High in the Andes in a little town called Belen, we learned from master tanners the basics of tanning, finishing and working leather. We learned the individual touch each hide needs and how leather can be crafted into a beautiful product. We understood with something as noble as leather, we needed excellent complimentary materials such as real brass fittings, durable zippers, tough waterproof linings and high tensile strength nylon thread just to name a few. Only qualified artisans can fashion these materials into beautiful products that we call ""Masterpieces in leather"". For over 45 years we have demonstrated our philosophy through our firm commitment to our products by offering a lifetime guarantee on all manufacturing defects.","Apparel and Fashion","11-50 employees","Privately Held","Miami, FL","United States","landleather.com","https://www.linkedin.com/company/landleatherbrand"

Rudes grew up in a family that redefined and pioneered premium denim. At age 18 he began working with his father, who founded J Brand Jeans. At J Brand, he learned the processes involved in making denim and how to build a global company. After years of working behind the scenes with elite brands, both Rudes and Dann opened their own retail projects. Listening to their customers’ feedback, the designers began experimenting with creating a jean with an updated fit, one that was tailored true to men’s bodies, movements, and elevated styles.

 

The result is a collection of perfected jeans that are designed to be worn every day and move seamlessly from day to night. Made in Los Angeles from denim experts behind some of the most iconic brands in the global market, MONFRÈRE is a label that is focused on fit, fabric, and details.

 

The designers start with the highest quality fabrics from the most exclusive mills in Japan that push the boundaries of what denim can look and feel like. Every garment is meticulously and expertly designed, with every detail considered. The brand’s loyal following is built through its impeccable signature fits - The Greyson, The Brando, and The Deniro - that are each designed to cater to every style and occasion with the utmost emphasis on comfort.

We have a fantastic team of individuals all striving to build a brand that can compete with the leaders in our industry. Our passionate team works together to provide high quality products and outstanding customer service.

We, like many, wanted to make a splash when we landed in the footwear ocean. With 30 billion pairs of footwear produced worldwide in 2017, this was not an easy task. We looked at hundreds of other styles and started to notice some common trends. If it was stylish, it was overpriced and uncomfortable. If it was comfortable, it was unsightly, and still overpriced. So we had a couple questions, “Why do comfort and style dislike each other so much?” and “Why is footwear so expensive?” Well guess what, comfort and style can actually get along quite nicely, and footwear doesn’t have to break the bank. 

When we set out to create the Cascade flip flop, we had four simple guidelines: MAKE IT COMFORTABLE, MAKE IT STYLISH, MAKE IT AFFORDABLE, and MAKE IT IN THE U.S. That’s it, four simple rules. If we can design a product that hits all four of these points, then we are going to make a splash. Well we’re making a splash; and not one of those pencil dive into the pool kind of splashes… nope. We went full blown cannonball. The fun colors and sleek design combined with unmatched comfort at a fair price make the Cascade flip flop a must have. And one more thing, it’s made right here in the U.S.A.

One of our original designers, Anna Woloshko, has been beckoned by the city lights and returned to San Francisco to give our brand a new casual look and feel.
 
Our California dream-inspired designs are lovingly handcrafted right here at home with our signature comfort fabric that is as luxuriously soft and gentle as a cool Pacific breeze. From basic to fashion pieces, and everything in between, we’re bringing you casual, modern and super soft pieces in beautiful seasonal colors that fit you—and your life—perfectly.

You know that feeling when a place is so beautiful and relaxing you don’t want to leave? Our clothes are kind of like that. Once you slip into them, you slip into the California state of mind, and you’ll never want to leave. They are that, early morning stroll on the beach with the sun on your face and the wind in your hair, comfortable.

,"Golden Bear Sportswear / GB Sport","Golden Bear Sportswear, one of the great heritage companies of America, was founded in San Francisco during the early 1920′s. Our classic, vintage American styling has always been the reason for the success and longevity of Golden Bear. In the early 1900′s, San Francisco’s destination shipping industry created a market for durable dockworker jackets. Golden Bear jackets kept the longshoremen warm on cold and foggy San Francisco nights.

In the 1950′s we began to produce The Varsity Jacket, the Bomber Jacket, and the Motorcycle jacket. We made award jackets for high schools and colleges thru out the USA. In the 1960′s the music scene exploded in San Francisco. Just as the love children flocked to Golden Gate Park, famous musicians found their way to our workshop. Members of the Jefferson Airplane, The Grateful Dead, The Doobie Bros and many more traveled to the Mission District, anxious to create a custom jacket for their band.

Word got out about this family business in San Francisco. The Golden Bear bomber jacket with a real shearling lining was sold from Maine to Oregon. Chamois Shirts and lamb suede Safari jackets for the new trend of fashion were sold nationwide. In the 1970′s, Golden Bear was introduced to the Japanese Market. Until now, Golden Bear garments can be seen in the best retail shops in Japan.

Golden Bear has dressed Presidents, Heads of State and Dignitaries from around the World. From the top Internet companies to the best of Detroit, Golden Bear has customized jackets that last a life time for their employees.

At this point Jack had no way of knowing that his vision would acquire a lasting reputation as the originator of the hand knit novelty sweater.  BEREK sweaters were introduced in 1977 and immediately generated a “ revolution in the fashion world.”  After all of these years, the name BEREK continues to be held in the highest esteem among those who know and collect “art you can wear” sweaters.

     BEREK produces sweater knits, jackets, dresses, handbags, pajamas, t-shirts, shoe bags, spa wraps, velour suits, home furnishing accessories, and more… An outstanding team of specialty designers, headed by Jill Rogers, designs the products.  The design team travels to Europe and other parts of the world for new ideas.  They combine various yarns, 3D embellishments, hand embroidery, and labor-intensive beadwork to keep BEREK at the forefront of the industry.

In a matter of just a few years Shahida’s personal dream for designing her own clothing collection came to life and she launched Shahida Parides, a contemporary, glamorous, ready-to-wear collection that began with her modern take on traditional kaftans and halter dresses. It also included her signature digital prints and bold solids. 

Inspired by breathtaking creativity of other cultures, Shahida’s world travels and the mystical allure of nature. Shahida Parides has now expanded beyond iconic kaftans and signature prints to include a full wardrobe of ready-to-wear, swimwear, resort and luxury collection. Celebrities, actors and socialites have been spotted wearing Shahida Parides. Whether it’s on a yacht in St. Barthes, at the music festival Coachella, dinner with friends or on the red carpet, Shahida strives to design for women who know that their lives can change at any moment and want to live as though it already has. 

The new exclusive customization collection will launch in 2017.

,"Heathlander","Heathlander co-founders Teddy Lynn and Mark Himmelsbach are passionate about the game of golf. Through their boutique New York ad agency, Episode Four, they have done a lot of work in the golf industry including producing ""The Challengers"" for Charles Schwab, a series about people changing the game of golf for the better (schwabgolf.com/challengers). But golf was in their blood long before they were in the ad business. Mark grew up in a golfing family in Michigan - one of the states in The U.S. where true Heathland golf can be found and Teddy spent much of his youth playing the renowned Heathland golf courses in the south of England. His high school matches often took him to Sunningdale, The Berkshire, Woking and New Zealand, all true Heathland gems. Their ambition with Heathlander is to build a golf brand for proper golfers - golfers who have the spirit of Heathlanders - and they plan to do it with a range of high quality products that will allow such golfers to play well, look good and brave the elements.

,"Italeau","We believe in an intelligently designed, luxuriously handmade shoe. Our luxurious aesthetic stands apart from the crowd as we pay homage to an old world craft learned and passed down by the Italian artists of shoemaking. Soft, supple, waterproof leather and long-lasting structure promise a shoe of unwavering comfort.

We believe all shoes must serve basic functions to protect your feet - provide you with comfort and good posture and be durable. A shoe is a unique object: it supports and thus impacts our entire body, it is at ground level and thus must withstand the elements. A shoe that isn’t fully functional is not truly a shoe and is not truly luxurious.

We believe that as citizens of the world we have a duty to care for our fellow human beings. As such we chose to manufacture our product in Italy were craftsmen are fairly paid and protected. We also chose to provide clean water access to people in need. We embrace and support a cohesive world as our ethos, where we are mindful in our lives and our choices that impact the world in which we live.

And so we created ITALEAU.

We named ITALEAU after a play of words: ITALY + EAU. ITALY is the cradle of luxury shoemaking, artistry and craftsmanship, Italy is where it all began. EAU is water in French, we believe life begins with water - as such all our shoes are water-friendly and with every purchase ITALEAU provides clean water access to an individual in need in the developing world.

ITALEAU is a soulful, passionately designed and produced footwear with waterproof leather and construction, luxuriously handcrafted from the old-world heritage of artisan shoemakers bringing to you every-day luxury, thoughtful aesthetic that represents an ease of living - appreciation, consciousness, simplicity and taste.

With ITALEAU we want to bring you true luxury: a beautiful, luxurious shoe that is also fully functional and crafted consciously.","Apparel and Fashion","11-50 employees","Privately Held","Sausalito, CA","United States","italeau.com","https://www.linkedin.com/company/italeau"

,"BRABAR","BRABAR reimagined bra shopping for the next generation.  We produce comfortable, wire-free bras, bralettes, and underwear to fit the growing needs of teens, juniors, and young women with fits for AA - DDD cups; At BRABAR, we believe comfort is the foundation of Confidence. 

We promote self-love & aspire to cultivate strong, confident young women who recognize a simple, empowering truth: you are so much more than your body; you are somebody. 

We encourage them to recognize their strengths, weaknesses, dreams, passions, accomplishments, failures, and everything in between & their bodies are just one aspect of the fantastic, dynamic individuals they are.


BRABAR is NOT JUST A BRA for teenage girls. We are impacting change and shifting the conversation from Body Image to Self-love. 
We are changing how teens shop for bras and taking the guesswork out for mom! 

At BRABAR, we help teen girls feel comfortable and confident in their skin while giving them the tools to be their best selves. There is a strong connection between intimate apparel and how girls think about themselves. Coming of age opens floodgates of information and emotion for girls. Unrealistic expectations and social media are negatively impacting the psychological development of teen girls. Embarrassment about changing bodies & growing up escalates girls' concerns about body image. 

BRABAR was born of a desire to educate teenage girls about fit and the importance of wearing the right size bra; because comfort is the foundation of Confidence. Women today do not know how to measure themselves; in fact, 8 of 10 wear the wrong size bra. OUR EZ-fit method teaches young women to find the correct band measurement: essential to a proper fit. 

We achieve comfort by finding the right bra fit and teaching girls to shop by band size. Getting into and wearing a bra that is just right is fundamental!

,"SKIN-EEZ Skincarewear","SKIN-EEZ Skincarewear, the industry leader in comsetotextiles, was created to revolutionize the market by offering items - from medical compression garments that promote wellness, to everyday shapers - that contour and support the body, while they soothe, moisturize, and protect the skin.

Michelle Moran is an established entrepreneur with more than 15 years of apparel industry experience and a recognized leader in promoting social causes through fashion. In 2007, recognizing the enormous potential for cosmetotextile applications in the North American apparel market, Michelle developed her newest line, – SKIN-EEZ Skincarewear -- which uses patented microencapsulation technology to deliver natural cosmetic ingredients to firm, tone, and slim while wearing SKIN-EEZ. 

Michelle’s vision arrived from the experienced she had while wearing post surgery compression garments recommended by her doctor. Realizing how uncomfortable and painful the garments made her feel, she knew that the industry would benefit from cosmetotexiles. SKIN-EEZ is changing the expectations that women have of their clothing by offering items — from post surgery undergarments that promote wellness, to everyday shapers, and active wear that contour and slim the body, while delivering moisturize onto the skin.

Through clinical studies and the invention of SKIN-EEZ Skincarewear (comfortable garments with moisturization), Michelle was able to show an increase of 19% in the skins elasticity and create real comfort while wearing it. With women’s fast paced lifestyles of managing a family and career, SKIN-EEZ Skincarewear takes care of women’s skin all day and night just by wearing the garments they love every day.","Retail Apparel and Fashion","11-50 employees","Privately Held","Newton, Massachusetts","United States","myskineez.com","https://www.linkedin.com/company/skin-eez-skincarewear"

,"Mad Gringo","We all have a Mad Gringo deep down inside.

Mine came out in October 2006. I'd been feeling penned in and stressed out for months - maybe years. So I hopped a plane to Mexico, hoping to find myself- literally and figuratively - on a warm, sandy beach.

Instead, I found someone else.

Here was the man I was not. Deeply tanned. Carefree. Going slow.

I had to know his secret.

We talked over a bottle of tequila. I unloaded my frustration with corporate life. The shallowness. The push for more and more. The feeling of less and less. I got angry explaining my job and life. The traffic. The ties. The stress.

He just smiled and shucked more oysters. He had no secret, he assured me.

So over a second bottle, we just talked. With a warm breeze in our faces, and the sound of crashing waves in the air, talk drifted here and there. People. Places. Love. Loves lost. From the same spot on the beach where we saw the sun drop, we watched it rise again.

And right then and there, I named my new company.

As a college student in 1979, Gloria immersed herself in her family’s fabric business. It was here that she gained a deep understanding of premium fabrics, a knowledge that she has since implemented at gls. Today, our dresses are made with only the highest quality fabrics.

As a single young woman, Gloria owned and operated a women’s apparel production business, where she learned the art of making quality women’s clothing. Our dresses today are handcrafted and produced with the most care, detail, quality control and made to fit beautifully.

After getting married and giving birth to her first daughter in 1989, Gloria opened her first high-end womenswear boutique. From working intimately with designer brands, she not only honed an eye for craftsmanship but also discovered the industry-wide practice of high markups. At gls, we deliver products with the acute attention to detail and quality of luxury brands but without the high markup.

Over the next couple of decades, Gloria built and cemented strong relationships with the production factories used top designer brands she carried in her boutique. These are the gold standard factories producing gls dresses today.

In 2013, gls collective was born. Using her own initials as well as those of her two daughters Liz and Sarah for the name, Gloria wanted to offer to today’s customer dresses made with the same passion and care she has devoted to her own daughters. At gls, we want our customers to look and feel their absolute best without having to break the bank.

,"LEOVICI","Details matter.

At least for Brent Wheatley, a former professional baseball player who created the LEOVICI brand with the same exacting precision he used to prepare for big games.

Drawing from concepts of minimalism, function, and form fit, LEOVICI is breaking new ground, occupying its own space as it combines high fashion and premium athletic apparel.

While the brand itself is young — the first collection launched in 2019 — its roots in the industry are three generations deep.  Wheatley’s grandfather was on the original board of Nike. His dad was a co-owner of Travis Mathew.

Now Brent is carving out his own voice, developing a unique line that harnesses the comfort of sportswear while commanding the respect of designer clothing. He creates luxury-quality, small-batch, versatile pieces that can be worn anywhere, meant to toe the line between fashion and utility.

Dedicated to creating everything in the US and collaborating with local artisans, nothing is overlooked, and every stitch matters. These values are in the name itself. LEO meaning lion, VICI the Latin word for “I conquer.” Together they represent the beauty of bold simplicity, power through confidence, and earned success.

LEOVICI isn’t meant for everyone. It’s clothing for those who approach the world with intention. Who value strength and poise over flash. Who exudes calm and controlled swagger, moving between boardrooms and ballfields and time spent with family with a shared belief that above all else — details matter.","Retail Apparel and Fashion","11-50 employees","Public Company","Tustin, California","United States","leovici.com","https://www.linkedin.com/company/leovici"

,"The Cincinnati Sustainable Fashion Initiative","The Myron E. Ullman, Jr. School of Design in collaboration with The OR Foundation (led by Liz Ricketts) launched the Sustainable Fashion Initiative in August 2018 to cultivate a zero-waste (circular) culture within the fashion program and to advocate for sustainable fashion practices across campus and within the broader Cincinnati community.

Waste is an artifact of a broken fashion system. Waste occurs at all points along the lifecycle of our clothing and waste is directly tied to the human exploitation found in the production, consumption and 'waste management' of fashion.

SFI is founded on the belief that if we change how we think about and deal with waste, we could change our entire relationship to fashion.

The fashion program at the Myron E. Ullman Jr. School of Design is a microcosm of the dominant fashion model - a linear system. With this in mind, SFI's primary mission is to 'deal' with the waste generated by the fashion program - to reduce waste, to innovate with our waste and to ultimately design a system that eliminates what we currently term 'waste' by developing a circular fashion system within the program. SFI seeks tangible localized solutions, not theoretical proposals.

SFI will need to establish relationships with the local community as well as with the global sustainable fashion movement. SFI will learn from leaders in circular systems and all research and learnings generated by SFI will be made available to the public.

Because everyone wears clothing and because the SFI is committed to advocacy and community building a majority of programming will be open to all UC students as well as the general public.

,"GROUPE Inc","GROUPE is more than a menswear boutique located on the Bowery, featuring 3 in-house collections: 
Seize Sur Vingt, Troglodyte Homunculus, and United Boroughs.  

We are a collective of young designers who will shape the fashion dialogue. We are an incubator that supports the growth of today's most exciting talent. And we are a curator of design -- offering our clients the chance to become fashion patrons and support emerging talent.

GROUPE started with a question. How do we foster and support the voice and vision of emerging designers?

The traditional model for the fashion industry is broken, with no real support for its emerging artists. Young talent spend their most unjaded creative years in support roles making tech packs. Imagine telling Adele that she would have to sing backup for 15 years.  There simply aren’t opportunities for new designers to have a credible chance at independence unless they have both business acumen and access to significant capital. If we are going to change the narrative, we need to rethink the power structures and roadblocks that exist today in the fashion industry. 

That is why we created GROUPE. To change the narrative, and to flip the model on its head. We are creating the first genuine and sustainable platform that connects independent, emerging and aspiring designers to a community of early-adopters who are looking for more meaning in the things they wear. 

GROUPE selects emerging designers who create capsule collections or launch new brands with us. We provide the funding for samples and production, as well as the marketing and distribution.  GROUPE leverages 20 years of experience and infrastructure as well as the closely-connected clientele and support network of the Seize sur Vingt luxury menswear brand.  The physical space is a dynamic and engaging venue to test-market samples and new concepts—a fashion petri dish. 

Our In-house labels: 
Seize sur Vingt:  Launched in 1998, SSV is a family-owned menswear label known for its bespoke services, slimming cuts, high-quality Italian fabrics (160s), and a wide palette of classics that appeal to an urban professional clientele. 

Troglodyte Homunculus: Funny name, serious style. Seize sur Vingt’s younger, carefree brother, “Trog” offers playful separates for the urban wanderer. 

United Boroughs: Rooted in urban lifestyle, UB incorporates advanced construction, and elevated aesthetics into a forward-thinking collection.

,"Playback Clothing","We exist to make better clothing in a better way. To make you look and feel better.
To make the Earth a cleaner place.

Our process is better because we recycle. What do we recycle? Well, anything and everything…as long as that thing can be used to make high-quality clothes. That’s the key. We never treat making better clothes and helping our environment as two separate things. 

PLAYBACK makes recycled cotton T-shirts and sweatshirts are made from collecting post-industrial cotton scraps and plastic and glass bottles and sorting them by color. They are then broken down into fiber form and paired with other fibers (recycled cotton or polyester, depending on what we started with) to add softness and durability. The fibers are then re-spun into yarn and knitted into PLAYBACK t-shirts, sweatshirts, and hoodies. We’re not talking about a solar-paneled suit or pants made out of leaves, we’re talking about clothes you actually want to wear that happen to help the environment.

We make our recycled fabrics truly unique by introducing color, texture, and pattern to a sustainable apparel market that (in our opinion, anyway) is a little too bland and boring. We want to push the boundaries of eco-apparel in a way that promotes quality, innovation, and sustainability.
Who We Are

We are not a company of ardent environmentalists here to condemn every iota of energy used or plastic fork in existence. It is not a requirement that everyone working for us to wear Birkenstocks, go kayaking, and eat granola.

,"HBarC Ranchwear","In 1897, a young tailor from Brooklyn named Samuel Christenfeld decides to start designing luxury clothing  with an “english riding flare” and called it ""Tailoring by Christenfeld, in Brooklyn, NY”. Nine years later, in 1906, he formed a  partnership with Mel Halpern and officially changed the name to Halpern and Christenfeld.

After a few years of being partners Christenfeld decided to buy out Halpern, take controlling interest of the company, and changed the name to H-C for legal purposes. Shortly after he changed the name, again, to H Bar C.

After Halpern died in 1929. Christenfeld continued building the brand and company with his five sons; Bernard “Bernie”, Seymour, Stanley, Leonard, and Paul.

After Samuel’s death in 1939, HBarC focused on the western market, and started to grow internationally. Seymour moved to California to open the Los Angeles office and established the Hollywood arm of the brand. Catering to the hollywood elite, HBarC supplied clothes for western movies clothing the likes of Gene Autry, Roy Rogers, John Wayne, Elvis Presley, John Travolta to name only a few. 

HBarC recruited Nudie Cohn, the famous Rodeo Tailor to begin designing shirts for the brand. HBarC actually produced some of Nudies production lines. They pushed the limits of that day with embroidery and appliqué work, and many of these advances became the new standards in western wear.

 Even though production of the brand in the United States stopped, vintage trading of HBarC became popular on the internet and with the original quality of products being so high, they have endured and continue to be traded to this day.

The Company is resurrecting its American production and proud to be coming back to market with a line of HBarC classics as well as new pieces inspired by HBarC traditions. Entertainers are excited to have access to the garments once again and allow the Grand Old Brand to come back to life in the music industry.

About Us - 

We know baseball. We love baseball. To us the other sports are a necessary evil – sports that were created by those that did not understand our great game… maybe they didn’t understand it, maybe they weren’t good at it; you be the judge. This exact passion for baseball is why Korked is so righteous. We don’t do football. We don’t do basketball. We don’t do soccer. We do baseball and only baseball. We have put painstaking effort into our Bullpen Blog and apparel; engineering everything for our toughest critics, true ball players. And after years of development and fine tuning, we have finally emerged with a product that meets—no, exceeds – a ball players highest standards for apparel excellence. 

Simply put, Korked is the best apparel brand out there. Comfortable, soft, aerodynamic and most of all utterly RAW, Korked is everything a baseball brand should be. We are a weekend BBQ in the sun. That perfect day out at the ball game. Hitting dingers and rounding the bases. Striking out the side, for 9 straight innings. Korked is a mixture of a Rollie Fingers mustache and a Tim Lincecum flow. Don’t take our word for it, though, try our apparel out for yourself. If you are not satisfied send your order back. Simple as that. That is why we have such a lenient return policy – because our gear speaks for itself. It’s time to take the plunge and join the home run pimping, hair flowing, non-semi pro brand. Your batting average and ERA will thank you for it.","Retail Apparel and Fashion","11-50 employees","Partnership","Milwaukee, WI","United States","korkedbaseball.com","https://www.linkedin.com/company/korked-baseball"
,"Cop.Copine US","Cop. Copine U.S. brings unmistakable cutting edge and urban style to the independent woman. Cop. Copine Paris, a creative impetus of over 30 years, is the inspiration behind the brand. Season after season, our clients have become veritable fans who patiently anticipate the launch of a new collection. 95% of the design and manufacturing process is done in Europe with careful attention given to detail and fabrics. This permits us to produce a clothing line of exceptional quality.

Through the efforts of the Cop. Copine Paris family and the U.S. owners, Cop. Copine U.S. opened its first stand-alone boutique at the prestigious Union Square location in San Francisco in August, 2009. Pasadena became the second host to this brand name in early 2016. The brand’s goal is to have a limited number of stores in select major U.S. cities in the future. This is in keeping with the uniqueness of the collection and to preserve the ideal of no mass production.

Cop. Copine U.S. is simply one woman’s vision. As a physician/surgeon, entrepreneur, humanitarian, artist and a visionary with a heart. The founder has always expressed herself differently than the average physician. She believes a woman can be great at her profession without compromising her expression of self; whether through fashion or the gentleness of her spirit. A dedicated customer of Cop. Copine for nearly 15 years, she knew that if Cop. Copine could make her happy given all of her demands, it could make other U.S. women happy as well.
In addition, Cop. Copine U.S. has altruistic goals that it will endeavor to achieve as it gets more established within the U.S. fashion world.","Retail Apparel and Fashion","11-50 employees","Privately Held","San Francisco, California","United States","cop-copineus.com","https://www.linkedin.com/company/cop-copine-us"

We know we’ll likely see old friends there, and if not, we’ll make new ones as we talk under ristras that swing gently like that’s what they were made to do. Tomorrow we’ll probably wake up early, put on hiking boots and a grab a camera to catch the sunrise, or maybe find the perfect spot to watch it go down with friends in the evening?

,"Elk Head Clothing","I grew up amongst the rolling hills and peaceful woodlands of Northern Michigan, where dressing smart meant layering on tough pieces against the cold and the rough touch of nature – practical clothing that got you through season after season. Here in the urban forest of Atlanta, smart clothing means something else – more refined, modern, clean. My designs reflect the mixing of these two worlds I’ve lived in, as well as a rejection of what fashion for the everyday guy has largely become – fast, cheap and pretty much disposable.

For a lot of reasons, I think we deserve more substance. That’s why Elk Head clothing is born of better stuff, for people who have outgrown the throwaway life.

We make clothes for people who keep appointments and promises, weekday schedules and friends longer than a season. We know that Supima cotton, vegetable-dyed leather made in a 100-year old midwestern factory, and legacy thread hand-stitched by a family in Italy has so much more to offer everyday pants and shirt wearers, even if it costs a little more. And we know that knowledge is half the battle against the empty calories of fast fashion and a disposable existence; that the more you understand about what makes a great shirt really great, the more likely you are to find yourself needing more things of like it in your life.

,"Rhyme&Reason Clothing","Rhyme&Reason, founded in 2011, began as a very simple idea by a group of like-minded people with a diverse range of backgrounds.

They believed that if people had the option to purchase their basic casual wear (the things we all need to buy eventually anyway), and have that purchase support a cause they personally cared about, people would grasp that opportunity to make a difference.
Consumers enjoy considerable purchasing power, often without realizing it. Understanding this, Rhyme&Reason felt that given the choice, consumers would use that power in a more sensible way, rather than buying designer labels that continue to benefit those who already have so much, consumers would instead prefer to direct that power toward having a positive impact on education, poverty, medical research, animal welfare and more....  the potential seemed limitless. 

 At Rhyme&Reason, consumers now have the choice to buy the highest quality, everyday casual wear, and at the same time see that purchase making a direct impact on making the world a slightly better place – for all of us.","Retail Apparel and Fashion","11-50 employees","Partnership","Flushing, NY","United States","rhymeclothing.com","https://www.linkedin.com/company/rhyme&reason-clothing"

We realize that some print shops have trouble getting your order to you when they say they will.  We strive to deliver all of our orders on-time, no matter the size.
 
Ontime was started in 2007 by three family members - Ben, John and Frank.  At that time the company was known as Milwaukee Custom Graphics, LLC.  Projects began to take shape in the form of signs and banners - but no job was off limits.  We turned Ben's condo into a full service print shop, taking orders and turning them around in record times.   It didn't take long before we outgrew the condo and had to move into an actual working space.  A year later we moved to the Brewers Hill area in Milwaukee and continued to grow.

In 2010 we moved our production facility to Whitewater, Wisconsin.  At the same time we expanded into the embroidery market.  We had two employees, a couple of old presses, a lot of motivation and ourselves.  Today we have some of the best equipment in the screen printing and embroidery world.  We also have a crew of over 25 people and we couldn't do it without them.
 
In 2015 we opened another location in Bay View, Wisconsin.  This spot housed all of our embroidery production.  It didn't take us long to outgrow this location.

In early 2020 we acquired a large building in New Berlin, Wisconsin.  We combined both of our production facilities under one roof.  Now we can offer a higher level of quality control and decreased turnaround times.  However, our Whitewater location is still open for business!

Then one day, two young UGA grads built a website called stuff4GREEKS.com (which later became S4G) that allowed fraternity and sorority members to design custom Greek gear from the comfort of home with no minimums, upload custom artwork or choose from thousands of designs, see a proof before production begins, and rest assured knowing that their quality custom piece will soon arrive on their doorstep.

Because of that, Greeks from all over the world were able to customize their paraphernalia online and no longer had to put up with bad quality and painful customer service at questionable embroidery shops. Orders grew exponentially, year after year. S4G added more machines and team members to keep up with demand.

Because of that, the S4G team quickly outgrew their home office and purchased a commercial building in midtown Atlanta, GA. They also opened a state-of-the-art brick and mortar retail store in 2009.

Now after over a decade of business and thousands of jackets later, S4G has perfected the craft and we are considered the experts of the Greek apparel industry. Our work has won contests and received tons of recognition, but we keep striving for perfection. Enough about us... how can we serve YOU? http://s4g.com","Apparel and Fashion","11-50 employees","Privately Held","Atlanta","United States","s4g.com","https://www.linkedin.com/company/stuff4greeks"

,"T.C. Elli's","At the ripe age of 24, in the year 2000, I decided to become a business owner in a West Texas college town called Lubbock.  Decidedly, this boutique would be a space where patrons ran the show.  Word quickly spread and TC Elli's started to grow into a beloved boutique created by customers, where luxury is about being one of a kind, not how much you spend. While trying on swanky outfits, talking about social events, and discussing trends, our clientele freed their fashion creativity and danced with bliss upon discovering TC Elli's.

Our TC Elli's staff is comprised of 27 down-to-earth girls, all under the age of 25 (what? I'm still 25! ok, myself being the one exception), who open massive amounts of clothing boxes, steam, tag, sensor, merchandise, model, assist customers, ship online orders, answer questions on the phone and so much more.  Very little is outsourced because we like to keep it in the family. Each one of us run social media sites, email customers about new arrivals, order clothing daily, take pictures daily, run fashion shows, and have socials.  We are a tight clan and strive to do our very best to encourage women in Texas to be a part of the small business chain.  All success is credited to the amazing women who have worked at TC Elli's during the last 18 years.  If it weren't for these ladies, TC Elli's would not be where it is today. There is deep love, dedication, and commitment rooted within the walls of this boutique.  We have also been rated Best Store in Lubbock by Shop Across Texas 3 years in a row! 

In January 2013, we launched our online store to spread the Texas love of ""Fresh-Eclectic-Fashion"" to the US.  New posh, swanky styles are posted every Wednesday and Friday. In January 2017 we opened a warehouse to accommodate even more of your fave pieces and expand our online store. We’ve devoted a lot of time to making tcellis.com a super fun place to spend some time, so please take a look around, make yourself at home, and enjoy the scenery.

,"UnderTech UnderCover","UTUC was founded in 2009 by Lenny Magill, a world recognized authority on firearm concealed carry. In examining the “wearable holster” products then on the market, Magill recognized the need for a higher quality option; produced with state-of-the art compression fabrics and superior, “Made in the USA,” hand sewn craftsmanship.

The first UnderTech Undercover product was the “Belly Band” now called, appropriately enough, the “Original Belly Band.” Even though we’ve sold over 150,000 units, this remains one of our most popular products… with most of our customers now being repeat buyers.

The FBI, CIA, Homeland Security, and undercover law enforcement officers from around the world quickly adopted the Original Belly Band as a preferred method of concealed carry. Based on their feedback, and their numerous requests, we subsequently developed our current lines of concealed carry T-Shirts and Shorts for both men and women.

UnderTech Undercover has become the most respected name in concealed carry undergarments and offers a full line of cut, colors, and fabrics to fill virtually any concealed carry application. At the 2014 Shot Show, FoxNews.com prominently featured UnderTech Undercover as one of the most innovative concealed carry products at the show.

In 2012, we introduced UnderTech Undercover - Travel and our line of Travel Safe products at the Travel Goods Show in Las Vegas Nevada. It was ""attendee voted"" as a “BEST PRODUCTS” at the show. It was also featured in numerous articles, blogs, video reviews and other media outlets associated with the travel industry.

Our Travel Safe line of products offers the same cutting edge fabric technology with old world craftsmanship to produce truly superior products. Featuring both item specific and generically sized pockets, Travel Safe security clothing is quickly becoming “must have” garments for the security minded traveler. 
UnderTech Undercover products, both concealed carry and travel specific, are sold though this website, as well as other concealed carry and travel specific websites. They are also carried at a number of fine retailers who specialize in those respective industries.","Retail Apparel and Fashion","11-50 employees","Privately Held","San Diego, Ca","United States","undertechundercover.com","https://www.linkedin.com/company/undertech-undercover"

,"PlugYourHoles","After 6 years of touring in multiple bands, Plugyourholes founder/owner Sam Dean found himself without a band, and without a job. With only his wife Laura's income, they sold everything they had, and instead of paying bills Sam went out and stood in line with friends to wait for the launch of a popular new video gaming system. After purchasing 7 of them, along with some ""Tickle Me Elmos"", they posted them all online and watched in complete disbelief as the amount that people were willing to pay for them seemed to have no ceiling.

They took that money, and once again chose not to pay the bills. Instead they went out and built a modest website and stocked it with the best plugs that they could find, and afford. The thought process behind this, was that they were sick of paying mall and tattoo shop prices for items that they knew were dramatically less expensive. Within a short time Plugyourholes became very successful, and all of the bills were finally paid.

Now, more than 10 years later, Plugyourholes sits atop a very competitive field in both clothing and body jewelry. In 2009 Plugyourholes had moved out of the Dean family residence to an office in downtown Duluth, MN. 2 years later in 2011 the company again moved. This time the move was to more centralized Kansas City, Mo. Over the first 10+ years of Plugyourholes, the company has done 7 years of the Vans Warped Tour, Bamboozle Fest, Soundwave (Aus), SXSW, Riot Fest, and much more. In addition to that, the website has over 80,000 customers and has fulfilled thousands upon thousands of orders.

The future is bright for Plugyourholes. Witness the rest for yourself.","Retail Apparel and Fashion","11-50 employees","Self Owned","Kansas City, Missouri","United States","plugyourholes.com","https://www.linkedin.com/company/plugyourholes"

Who is Jamila? That’s a vey good question. And the answer is…. every woman. Every woman is Jamila because Jamila means beautiful — inside and out. And every woman is beautiful, inside and out.

Sometimes we don’t show it.

Sometimes we don’t even know it.

But in those times when we flow it, we make all the difference. 

Jamila is about empowerment. About income and prosperity. About confidence and leadership. About learning and wisdom. About risk and reward. About experiences and growth. About fun. About abundance, acceptance, achievement. It’s about all the beauty in this world. All the beauty inside of you. All the beauty we can appreciate and create. 

The clothing, the jewelry, the accessories, the business model. These are all tools. The tools we use to create the opportunities that lead to the empowerment, income, prosperity, confidence, leadership, wisdom, risk, reward, experiences, growth, fun, abundance, acceptance, achievement and beauty.

Jamila is a young company. How we raise Jamila is important. We want Jamila to matter. Matter to you and your family. Matter to the women we care for and support. Matter to the economy. Matter to society. 

That’s why we decided on a business model that includes lots of entrepreneurs. We want to work with women from all walks of life. All pursuing the art of better. All wanting to improve themselves and their circumstances. All wanting a life of joy, abundance, freedom, growth, and prosperity. 

We’re having a lot of fun. When you find something you love and care about, the universe really does participate in helping. You finding us and reading this right now is proof of that precious participation. So thank you. Thank you for being here. Thank you for being interested. Thank you especially for wanting more for yourself and your family.

,"Carrot & Gibbs","Carrot & Gibbs was founded in Boulder, Colorado, in 1987. Neil Borin, one of the original owners, knows his bows. There are quite a few rules about bow tie wearing that simply go without saying; a bit like a secret handshake between aficionados. The same can be said of bow tie making.

You will never see a Carrot & Gibbs tie that has been fashioned out of stacked fabric and cut en masse. Carrot & Gibbs bow ties are created from specially selected imported 100% silk fabrics, predominately woven and printed. Each tie is individually cut, sewn and pressed by hand here in the United States. And rather than a metal clasp at the back, you will find mother-of-pearl buttons, which can be used for both adjustment and attachment if required. Of course.

The same attention to detail can be found in Carrot & Gibbs hand-rolled pocket squares, cummerbund sets, and waistcoats. Even the Carrot & Gibbs pre-tied bow, a style shunned by bow tie purists, is a fine bow tie, tied to perfection, then tacked with but a single thread. The company likes to call it a bow tie with training wheels waiting for the wearer to one day cut the thread and set himself free.

Carrot & Gibbs has annual orders from more than 450 fine men’s specialty stores, haberdasheries, and such respected department stores as Nordstrom, Nieman Marcus, and Saks Fifth Avenue.

Carrot & Gibbs is proud to be associated with this small piece of cloth with its 400-year heritage. The bow tie inspires a staunch loyalty that can only be understood by those independent thinkers who look into the mirror, tie their bows, and go forth as proud members of this civilized minority.","Retail Apparel and Fashion","11-50 employees","Privately Held","Boulder, CO","United States","greatbows.com","https://www.linkedin.com/company/carrot-&-gibbs"

,"Audrey & Bear","We help moms and dads, grandmas and grandpas, aunts and uncles, and everyone in between, celebrate every child in their life.
We firmly believe that every child is unique, and deserves something to flawlessly showcase that! Our customizable and personalized products allow for a unique, creative experience that result in the perfect product for each special, one-of-a-kind child.


Rachel, the founder and CEO of Audrey & Bear, created the very first personalized swaddle for her daughter back in 2014.
While pregnant with her second, Annabelle, she began to feel sad and guilty that everything she had for her to wear and use were hand-me-downs from her first daughter, Audrey; she so badly wanted to give her something that was uniquely hers! So, during one uncomfortable and sleepless night, she envisioned a swaddle blanket, created by her, perfect for her new babe. She got to work and found a way to create a comfortable, functional swaddle blanket that would celebrate Annabelle's birth in a way nothing else could. And so it began -- the first Audrey & Bear swaddle was born!

Since that day back in 2014, we've come a long way. We started out as a tiny Etsy shop, and through helping tens of thousands of our friends create unique products for the special children in their life, A&B has grown into everything incredible that it is today. Sometime in between all of that, a few years ago, swaddle4swaddle was implemented. Through S4S, every time one of our swaddle blankets are purchased, we donate a similar one to a baby in the NICU.

S4S is a program that we are so proud to be able to fulfill, & we absolutely cannot wait to help serve tens of thousands more of our new friends by helping create their own, unique product.","Apparel and Fashion","11-50 employees","Privately Held","Lindon, UT","United States","audreyandbear.com","https://www.linkedin.com/company/audreyandbear"

,"Planetcostume","Operating at www.planetcostume.com and www.planetsanta.com

Planetcostume and Planetsanta were established in 1997 as an extension of several large manufacturing costume companies which had been established in 1876 to 1943.  

The owners of those companies saw a change in the way that consumers were buying their costumes and Santa suits. They decided to start a new company to meet those new types of needs and to better meet the rapid paced internet environment. That new company was Planetcostume which also runs and owns Planetsanta.

Planetcostume is located in two separate locations in the greater Philadelphia area. The larger of the two locations is over 10,000 square feet, and has warehousing, manufacturing, offices, and design facilities in the building. Planetcostume is involved in creating some very unique items for the Christmas and costume industries.

In addition to retailing it’s products over the internet, Planetcostume wholesales it’s products to retailers and other internet dealers around the world. For that reason, you may sometimes see the same product that was created by Planetcostume being sold by another company.

Many of the products sold by Planetcostume are used by professional performers, theatrical productions, national theatre tours, school & college theatres, motion pictures, advertising agencies, party planners, production companies, professional sports teams, print & TV commercials, major corporations, televised parades, theme parks, and costume shops throughout the world.

Often Planetcostume will clean out the distributors when they think that a product is good, thereby becoming the only source with a proper level of inventory. Planetcostume does not just keep a couple of items on hand and consider itself ready for business. 

Planetcostume has well over 1,000,000 items in stock to choose from, making it by far the largest shop of it's kind in the US, and one of the largest on the internet.","Retail Apparel and Fashion","11-50 employees","Privately Held","Lafayette Hill, PA","United States","planetcostume.com","https://www.linkedin.com/company/planetcostume.com"

Everything comes out soft and rejuvenated, looking and feeling like new again.  And it’s gentle; it won’t fade colors or wear fibers; it’s non-toxic, hypoallergenic and 100% odor-free.  It is so well suited for the fine garments we specialize in.  And for our laundry services (wet cleaning), we use a natural, enzyme-based detergent that results in clean, fresh, bright garments.

With the popularity of Baabaazuzu fashion the company outgrew the basement and moved to 3 locations since. BaabaaZuzu's unique recycled garments and accessories have been named one of Michigan's ""50 New Businesses to Watch.""

,"Espiritu Culture LLC","While traveling in Mexico in 2016, Espiritu Founders Francisco Alvarez and Oscar Yapor met a group of Mexican shoemakers who shared the impacts of fast fashion on traditional crafts and artisan products.

With fashion companies using cultural products for seasonal styles, the Mexican huarache quality became obsolete, and was only available in very low quality with wear issues and slippery soles, which depicted a Mexican style, but not the amazing vernacular engineering of the artisan leather woven footwear.

Wanting to help the local economy, Espiritu started as a business model that advocates for the cultural legacy of Mexico and gives back to the community.

Espiritu offers huarache shoes made for the 21st century. 

 
Our Mission

In Espiritu, we foster a great work environment that preserves the traditional techniques of Mexico, promoting cultural awareness through high quality shoes hand-crafted by Native Mexican artisans that give back.

 

Our Values

-Equality in the Workplace: Our most valuable resource is our people. Our artisan products would be nothing without our Native Mexican artisans and their century-old weaving techniques. They deserve to be given credit for their hard work. Espiritu's focal point is making sure all our team is treated equally, paid fairly, and is offered the best and safest working environment. 

-Ethically Made Huarache Shoes: Besides having ethical principles in the workplace with our people, our main focus is to create Mexican leather shoes that are organically sourced and ethically made. We understand that the clothing industry is one of the major polluting industries in the world. In order to preserve a world for future generations, each one of us has the responsibility to protect the world we live in today. 

Espiritu comes from Spirit - that which connects us ALL.","Retail Apparel and Fashion","11-50 employees","Privately Held","Los Angeles, California","United States","espiritu.com","https://www.linkedin.com/company/espiritu-culture"

,"Skineez Skincarewear","SKINEEZ Skincarewear, the industry leader in comsetotextiles, was created to revolutionize the market by offering items - from medical compression garments that promote wellness, to everyday shapers - that contour and support the body, while they soothe, moisturize, and protect the skin.

Michelle Moran is an established entrepreneur with more than 15 years of apparel industry experience and a recognized leader in promoting social causes through fashion. In 2007, recognizing the enormous potential for cosmetotextile applications in the North American apparel market, Michelle developed her newest line, – SKIN-EEZ Skincarewear -- which uses patented microencapsulation technology to deliver natural cosmetic ingredients to firm, tone, and slim while wearing SKIN-EEZ. 

Michelle’s vision arrived from the experienced she had while wearing post surgery compression garments recommended by her doctor. Realizing how uncomfortable and painful the garments made her feel, she knew that the industry would benefit from cosmetotexiles. SKIN-EEZ is changing the expectations that women have of their clothing by offering items — from post surgery undergarments that promote wellness, to everyday shapers, and active wear that contour and slim the body, while delivering moisturize onto the skin.

Through clinical studies and the invention of SKIN-EEZ Skincarewear (comfortable garments with moisturization), Michelle was able to show an increase of 19% in the skins elasticity and create real comfort while wearing it. With women’s fast paced lifestyles of managing a family and career, SKIN-EEZ Skincarewear takes care of women’s skin all day and night just by wearing the garments they love every day.","Retail Apparel and Fashion","11-50 employees","Privately Held","Sudbury, Massachusetts","United States","myskineez.com","https://www.linkedin.com/company/skineez-skincarewear"

In 2017, mechanical engineers at a world-renowned university conducted a series of tests that illustrated why shoelaces come undone. They found that when running, the foot strikes the ground at seven times the force of gravity. Responding to that force, the shoelace knot stretches and then relaxes. As the knot loosens, the swinging motion of the leg applies an inertial force on the free ends of the shoelaces, leading to unravelling in as few as two strides.

The interlocking design of the Nobbits system eliminates knot stretching when your foot strikes the ground. With the ability to customize the tension at every eyelet set, the Nobbs keep the tension constant, eliminating the forces that cause the knot to unravel and the shoelace to loosen. The unique benefit of the raised 3D Nobb, strategically placed along both sides of the shoelaces, creates the ratchet system - which keeps each knot secure. The raised Nobb also maintains the ideal fit of the shoe. The Nobb rests outside each eyelet in the shoe holding the shoelace firmly in place during each movement of the foot.","Apparel and Fashion","11-50 employees","Privately Held","Madison","United States","nobbits.com","https://www.linkedin.com/company/nobbits-usa"

Mark sent his designs to a prestigious factory in Italy, the factory manager who had worked with brands such as Bally and Dolce & Gabbana in the past. After receiving Mark's sketches, he told him, ""I've been making shoes for nearly 40 years but have never seen styles like yours, I can see this becoming the next big brand, and I'd love to take on this work with you."" 

In Mark Chris' young brand life, the fashion house has become highly respected and credited by the media, celebrities and customers alike on its brand voice, modern yet timelessly classic and innovative designs, and exceptional quality - from the raw materials and start-to-finish Italian production, to the packaging and more. 

The brand is rapidly growing in Hollywood, with celebrity customers such as actor Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, actor and recording artist Donald Glover (aka Childish Gambino), comedian and talk show host Steve Harvey, rapper 2Chainz, NBA All-star Chris Paul, and others.

Launched in Melbourne in 2010 by designers Nadia Napreychikov and Cami James after their blog attracted a cult following for bold ideas and fashion forward theories, ‘DI$COUNT UNIVER$E’ attributes one of their original quotes as the backbone for their brand that has become an ‘international phenomenon’ (Vogue.com): DI$COUNT UNIVER$E is a brand, an idea, an image, a dialogue, a strategy, a transformation, a design, a blog, a motion picture, a label, a personality, a website, a quote, a garment, an emotion and an evolution. DI$COUNT UNIVER$E is whatever we are doing at the time.’  DU 2009

DI$COUNT UNIVER$E does not align itself with the traditional fashion seasons rather it takes itself as seriously as the fashion system takes its consumer. DI$COUNT UNIVER$E mirrors how the web operates as a system, releasing small, erratic collections, sometimes even of one, or no garments. The evolution of the online consumer has superseded the industries pace; with the evolution of the web and democratisation of citizen journalism, in the form of the blog and social media, the system is outdated. DI$COUNT UNIVER$Erecognises that the virtual consumer greatly differs to the traditional fashion consumer, and provides an outlet to satisfy these buying trends. DU pieces are produced to align with consumer spending patterns rather than a superfluous system that doesn’t make sense for the new breed of consumer.","Retail Apparel and Fashion","11-50 employees","Privately Held","New York","United States","discountuniverse.com","https://www.linkedin.com/company/discount-universe"

,"BRD's Flip-Flops","Welcome to Brandi Renee Designs and BRD’s!  These two powerhouse brands were created from the mind of award winning designer and entrepreneur, Brandi Renee Day, who has more than 30 years’ experience designing and creating interior spaces and home décor. She simply put her mind to designing her vision and many new and innovative products were born.  Brandi’s idea of designing fashion forward products for home and personal wear finally came to fruition when she created a pair of flip flops with interchangeable straps and jewel snaps.  After designing several homes for her clients and now partners, Wally and June Blume in 2010, on the porch of their Costa Rica Penthouse, they decided to bring to the market Brandi’s new inspired design of a flip flop that would be able to travel with ease and match everything that someone wanted to wear.

 June was her biggest inspiration since she had been wearing Brandi’s prototypes and between June’s extensive travel  and exquisite fashion sense, they kept expanding upon the design.  With Wally’s unlimited business knowledge and wisdom they moved forward and patented her new dream, the train never stopped. They opened their home office in Southlake, Texas with just over 1,000 square feet.  They began to manufacture prototypes as well as grow their ever increasing interior design business.   Now Brandi Renee Designs is a name that is known for creating products that are fun and playful and designs that are luxurious and elegant.

Now Brandi Renee Designs, LLC is a family oriented business as her oldest daughter, Jamie Day-Jaramillo,  oversees operations as the President and her youngest daughter, Samantha Day watches the bottom line as the Director of Accounting and Photography.  Now the headquarters for Brandi Renee Designs is a 10,000 square foot facility with 15 employees and growing.","Apparel and Fashion","11-50 employees","Public Company","Southlake, TX","United States","brandireneedesigns.com","https://www.linkedin.com/company/brd's"

,"Bebe Sweeny","Bebe Sweeny is  a refined European clothing brand for children. Beautiful and unique high quality kid approved clothing for kinds from newborn to teens.

Our Story :

Originally from France and living in New York for several years, Estelle sought to prepare a birth kit for her little daughter Tanya that would have soft and refined items in the spirit of all that can be found in France.
After scouring without success the boutiques and famous stores in New York, it was only in France that she managed to find what would make the first wardrobe of her daughter.

Meanwhile, Valerie, with her heart balancing between France and New York for the past 25 years, is passionate about the lifestyle à la française. She surrounds herself with beautiful objects, adoring the feel of beautiful materials, appreciating the fine details of a garment, and would love to export this passion to the USA, with the aim of introducing it in the realm of babies.

Between these two women, then was born the project to create and launch Bebe Sweeny – a high-end european clothing line combining the best taste of French fashion.

At the beginning, it was only for babies , but they quickly grown among the american market and due to popular demand, they add range of sizes for girls. 

Bebe Sweeny has 3 brands :

- Bebe Sweeny : From 0m to 18m, elegant baby layette, childcare items..

- Sweeny : From 6m to 4y, trendy and chic clothing line for little girls

- Sweeteen : From 6y to 16y, modest-chic collection only for girls

They have the wish of bringing to the American moms the refined details and high quality that characterizes the famous French Touch, that's why the collections are designed in France and made in Europe !","Retail Apparel and Fashion","11-50 employees","Privately Held","Brooklyn, New York","United States","bebesweeny.com","https://www.linkedin.com/company/bebe-sweeny"

,"Wendell Walton Clothing Company","It all started on a chilly day in 1999. Dr. Wendell Becton was working as a team physician at a high school football game. The realization set in that if required he would have to perform medical care in frigid conditions. Dr. Becton thought to himself that a hoodie with a turtleneck built in would help to protect against wind and cold air far better than the average hoodie. It was then and there that the concept for the TURTLEHOODIE was born.

,"Lucky Dog Volleyball","Lucky Dog Volleyball is the nation's leader in volleyball sales and services. We sell uniquely-designed apparel and host skills clinics and showcase events.

At Lucky, our purpose is to create equitable access to volleyball gear, resources and information. We aim to design volleyball gear that is original, functional and stylish, while providing resources and services to the volleyball community. Our work is guided by five simple values.

CUSTOMER FOCUS
We keep players, coaches, officials, parents, and fans at the center of our designs and services. We plan and run events that blend the needs of organizers with the goals of our athletes. We remain approachable in order to encourage feedback in all areas of the business.

EQUITY OF ACCESS
We provide flexible consignment opportunities to the volleyball community that allows for autonomy in pricing and volume, to meet the needs of their market. We plan a tournament tour that is intentionally focused in regions where access is limited.

PERSONAL RESPONSIVENESS
We pride ourselves on our friendly approach to customer service. We ensure that someone will answer the phone when you call, or we will return your call promptly, usually within 24 hours. We listen, take note, and then take action.

WIN-WIN NEGOTIATIONS
We believe a deal is only good if it benefits all parties involved. For this reason, we seek and make deals that are mutually beneficial, then pass the benefits of such deals to our customers.

PEOPLE OVER PROFITS
We are committed to conducting business by doing what is right — all the time, even when it costs us more money or time. We believe the benefits of doing what's right are far more important than doing things the easy way.

,"Custom Universe","We offer customization for the most premier brands in the apparel industry. Quality products, all-inclusive pricing, GUARANTEED delivery dates, FREE shipping, and the very best customer service. 

While our company was officially established in 2007, the Custom Universe story actually begins a few years earlier. We've been best friends since high school and first started selling novelty t-shirts to Boston College students out of our backpacks. Soon we got requests from friends at other schools and started Rack 'Em Tees, an online store that allowed us to market our shirts to students around the country. 

We also started receiving requests for other quality custom products from various groups and teams and realized there was far greater demand for this kind of service. In 2009, we officially closed up shop at Rack ‘Em Tees and Custom Universe was born. 

As college athletes and a member of a fraternity, we had first-hand experience with the low-quality products and terrible turnaround times that some other companies offer. Based on this experience, we set out to create a company that would offer high quality products and decoration services backed by a delivery date guarantee. We made it our mission to obtain the most desirable, highest quality, brand name products and began development of a state-of-the-art website design platform to help our customers get exactly what they want on their apparel.","Retail Apparel and Fashion","11-50 employees","Privately Held","Everett, Massachusetts","United States","customuniverse.com","https://www.linkedin.com/company/custom-universe"

Nuonchic, Inc. was founded in January 2020 in the Bay Area. As an Asian woman, co-founder of Nuonchic Jayeon Kim, experienced early on the struggle of finding lingerie that fit her in stores. Just because she had a different body shape, she had to go through the experience of feeling unwelcomed, unwanted, and different. Because she struggled with her own size, Jayeon was determined to create a technology solution that would empower women to find their size and shop with ease. She wanted the invasive and very personal experience of bra sizing, to be one of comfort and ease. 

Who We Are: 
Nuonchic is an innovative e-commerce underwear and lingerie curation platform company that helps women find their perfect body and bra size with advanced self-measuring technology. With new technological innovations, Nuonchic is reshaping the underwear and lingerie industry by transforming the traditional bra-fitting and customer-driven shopping experience. 

Our Mission:
Nuonchic believes our self-measuring technology is the best ever tool for supporting consumer shopping experience and satisfaction in the underwear and lingerie industry.  There has been no innovation for bra-fitting measurement systems since 1920 even though the market and consumer’s needs are evolving.

ANASTASIIA IVANOVA is a luxury womenswear brand that embodies elegance, sophistication, and the quiet power of femininity. More than just fashion, it is a philosophy—an invitation to embrace refined taste and timeless style.

Rooted in a poetic vision of the female silhouette, the brand’s aesthetic balances delicate craftsmanship with modern sensibility. Each dress is a manifestation of grace, designed to enhance a woman’s innate beauty and confidence.

To help that goal, we recently moved to a new state-of-the-art building in New Jersey. Today, our products are located in over 1,400 stores and we look forward to adding you to our list of happy customers.

In 1962, Irene Friedman and her son Leo saw an opportunity to import fine quality children’s apparel to the United States of America. Together they started Friedknit Creations. After a few years of growth, the company started its own manufacturing with one goal in mind, to provide the consumer with finely made garments at a price the average family could afford. As the company grew it became evident that larger facilities were needed, therefore they moved the manufacturing to the Philippines.

With these new facilities they expanded into fine smocked woven wear in addition to the fine knit wear that the company was already famous for. Today we are proud to be in our third generation of making beautifully designed and well-made children’s apparel.","Apparel Manufacturing","11-50 employees","Public Company","New Jersey, Clifton","United States","carriageboutique.com","https://www.linkedin.com/company/carriage-boutique"

,"Stowe Street","Our company was founded by lifelong best friends, Jess and Jen, who met in kindergarten at their elementary school located on Stowe Street. Having tired of paying a fortune for marked up costume jewelry from mass retailers during their teens and twenties, only to have it fall apart, the duo dreamed about addressing what was an ongoing challenge in their busy lives: how do I stay stylish without buying a new wardrobe each season?

Jess and Jen were certain that the answer was in accessories, but also knew that finding the right designers and manufacturers would be critical to their dream business' success.  Stowe Street was not Jess and Jen's first direct-to-consumer project.  Following in the footsteps of their first foray, Navali, a nautical men's accessories brand, Jess and Jen waited  to launch Stowe Street until their first project got its sea legs.

Today, Stowe Street offers a full line of affordable and fashionable jewelry and expands its selection of accessories with each season.

These are our core values at Stowe Street:

1) We believe that a carefully selected accessory can elevate an average outfit to an extraordinary ensemble; it's always the icing on the cake.  That's why we're updating our assortment of accessories seasonally to offer trendy accessories that will be the perfect accent to the classic pieces you already have in your closet.

2) No one should need to spend a million dollars to look like they did. Likewise, fashion jewelry doesn't need to be cheap just because you didn't spend a ton.  That's why we've chosen to defy the traditional retail model and offer you the best possible quality products at half the price of traditional retailers, directly from our manufacturers to our warehouse to you!

3) In fashion and life, we know that the greatest rewards require great risk, and that trends can change overnight.  That's why we're committed to putting you first by offering free shipping and free returns on all orders.","Retail Apparel and Fashion","11-50 employees","Partnership","Williston, VT","United States",,"https://www.linkedin.com/company/stowe-street"

As they began to develop a reputation, they began to be approached with lay-flat tubing, an indestructible material, and were struck with a new possibility. Why not divert the material, and find a way to upcycle it into something stylish? Thus began a lengthy quest to find a manufacturer, who was willing to try something new. Now, thanks to the tenacity of the Carpenters, the “trash,” is poised to make it’s arrival on the fashion landscape with this to say: Green is the new black!

,"AYA Eco Fashion","Our Peruvian roots and love for nature drove us to create the most sustainable clothing brand. We are Meli and Rensso, founders of AYA, and siblings who grew up in a Peruvian family in Los Angeles. Before we were even born, our parents migrated from Peru to California which turned their lives entirely upside down. They discovered a whole new way of living, as well as opportunities that would ensure a promising future for them and their future family - us.

Our mother grew up in a rural area in the Peruvian Andes, in a unique environment, surrounded by pristine nature. Living in harmony with her environment, she developed a deep connection and love for nature that she passed on to us, as she taught us about the sustainable Andean lifestyle, raising us to care about nature. When we were children, our mom would often tell us stories from her childhood about how she sewed her clothes and dyed them with natural dyes that she found outside of her house.

Our father also grew up in a small town in the Andes Mountains. He was raised by his aunts who pushed him to be an ambitious man, and later in his life successfully started his own business selling natural products. As we grew up, he would use any opportunity to teach us how to run a company.

Our parents gifted us with valuable knowledge and were our biggest inspiration that led us to create AYA.

We launched AYA at the beginning of 2022 with the goal to become the most sustainable brand to be able to revolutionize how fashion is made, to prevent global pollution. Our vision and mission embrace what is best for our people and planet.","Retail Apparel and Fashion","11-50 employees","Privately Held","Los Angeles, California","United States","ecoaya.com","https://www.linkedin.com/company/aya-eco-fashion"

,"Fit3D, Inc","We believe that the dimensions of the human body hold untapped potential.  

When analyzed individually, a user's body dimensions can uncover health and wellness information, help her shop for the right clothing size or even the right brand to best fit her body.  One day, with the partnerships we are forging, the world will automatically adjust to the dimensions of her unique body.

When analyzed anonymously at mass, the body dimensions of a population can help apparel and product brands ensure that they are designing products to best fit their consumers' bodies, help health organizations understand the dimension changes of nations, and so much more...

At Fit3D, Inc. we aim to harness this untapped potential and provide substantial value to our customers and users.  We do so by developing 3D body scanners, mobile body scanners, and predictive body measurement AI technology.  This technology is deployed into fitness and weight loss centers, hospitals, nutrition shops, apparel retail locations, and more.  

We provide our users with substantial value by being able to securely and privately review their data in interactive and useful ways whether it be for health and wellness or to find the perfect jeans.

Our customers are able to use our tools developed atop the completely anonymized scans to develop products to best fit their consumers' body dimensions.

We've placed more than 2,000 scanners to businesses in 55+ countries.  We've scanned over 1.2M bodies in the past 2 years and scan more than 60,000 new unique bodies each month.

We are the world's leader in body scanners deployed, number of scans captured, and we're scaling faster than any other company operating in this space.","Retail Apparel and Fashion","11-50 employees","Privately Held","San Mateo, California","United States","fit3dinc.com","https://www.linkedin.com/company/fit3d-inc"

Their first customers, a local sorority, placed an order for an upcoming social event and requested long sleeved pocket tees.  Their tee shirt apparel provider did not offer the style option; but, not wanting to disappoint their newfound clients, the two worked quickly to find a solution and fulfill the order. 

Offering a fellow fraternity brother, in need of a place to stay, free rent, they tasked him with cutting and sewing pockets onto the tee shirts for the sorority's order.  During this process, they found that differentiating the brand by offering contrasting pockets on varying shirt colors was an instant hit.

Employing some of the most talented seamstresses in the South, the brand currently manufactures the finest quality American Made apparel.","Retail Apparel and Fashion","11-50 employees","Privately Held","Tylertown, Mississippi","United States","fraternitycollection.com","https://www.linkedin.com/company/fraternity-collection"

,"Rebel Reaper Clothing Company","Rebel Reaper Clothing Company: Brand Story

From the bustling streets of Phoenix, Arizona, in 2016, emerged a brand that was destined to redefine the essence of apparel. Rebel Reaper Clothing Company, envisioned and brought to life by our audacious Owner and CEO, Matt, stands as a beacon of passion, quality, and storytelling in the world of fashion.

Our journey began with a simple yet profound belief: clothing should not just cover, but communicate; not merely protect, but express. With this ethos at its core, Rebel Reaper was born - a brand that promised to blend high-quality, premium materials with an unyielding passion for storytelling through apparel.

Our inception was humble, yet our dreams were anything but. We set out to create a brand where every stitch spoke of quality, every design echoed originality, and every garment was a testament to enduring style. Rebel Reaper is not just a brand; it's a narrative interwoven with traditional tattoo artistry, modern fashion sensibilities, and a classic twist that transcends time and trends.

As we evolved, our canvas broadened. Today, Rebel Reaper is a globally recognized name, synonymous with premium flannels, button ups, polo shirts, bespoke motorcycle vests, high quality jackets, and so much more that don’t just fit the body but fit the soul. Our men’s and women’s fashion lines are a nod to those who dare to be different, to those who wear their stories with pride.

Our growth is not just in our expanding global reach but in our commitment to creating fashion that’s more than mere clothing. Each piece from Rebel Reaper is a dialogue, a piece of art, a slice of rebellion against the transient and the ephemeral.

Mission Statement

Rebel Reaper Clothing Company is more than a brand; it's a revolution in apparel. Our mission is to empower and inspire. We craft clothing that’s a mirror to the soul, a reflection of the resilient and the bold.

,"BASILE & PAPE - fine jewelry for COOL people.","Designers Robin Basile and John Pape have worked in fashion since 1998 as fashion editors and photographers. In 2009 Robin was hired by C.A. Inc. to create a new division for the company to attract more of a fashion savvy clientele. Robin - along with her husband John, conceived, designed and promoted the entire division. After 9 months of phenomenal success, Robin & John decided to branch out on their own to continue their designs under their own name - Basile & Pape.

The inspiration for Basile and Pape’s designs stems from their many years as stylists on photoshoots and never being completely satisfied with the predominantly small and tame jewelry collections that were on the market. “We design with editors, stylists, and fashion-forward consumers in mind. We design big, substantial pieces that can be seen from afar and worshiped up close.""

,"SOAR, LLC dba Soar Clothing SoarClothing.com","About Us:
We are making a statement and Stand Out Above the Rest (SOAR). There are plenty of hot street wear lines with great designers, but very few of them are actually saying anything important or up lifting.  Your clothes are a billboard, and you're walking around advertising something or maybe nothing if it's a blank slate or a meaningless mass corporate design.   That advertisement says something about the person wearing it and has a manifestation or imprint effect (conscious or subconscious) on the people they come into contact with.  Why waste that valuable space?  Why not use it to uplift people’s Spirits?  In a world dominated by darkness, ignorance and negative messages, it's refreshing to see someone using that ""billboard"" space to communicate something positively filled with light and information.  For that brief moment you know that you are in harmony with the Universal Laws of Attraction, Giving and Receiving.  And that positive energy attracts more- it is infectious and magnetic.  With enough people catching on, we can start to change the low level, negative vibration on the Planet.  We can live our own dreams and not the ones others have created for us. We are messengers of conscious propaganda, and that with the ability to remain childlike is the key to life. Come SOAR with us!

Our Mission:
Stand Out Above the Rest (SOAR). To promote positive messages, knowledge, light, information, spirit and intellectual curiosity through fashion, entertainment, and media in order to help over come the negative messages that we are consistently faced with.

The Brand:
We firmly believe that through our products we will help to educate and increase the number of conscious, like-minded individuals around the world, and, in turn, increase their impact on their community. By serving as a visual and audio representation of the Conscious Shift, our brand will help to inspire action and combat the apathy that has taken over many aspects of life.","Apparel and Fashion","11-50 employees","Privately Held","San Diego, CA, CA","United States","soarclothing.com","https://www.linkedin.com/company/soar-llc"
,"Ezra Arthur","www.EzraArthur.com

Ezra Arthur is owned by four brothers, honoring their grandfather’s name by crafting lifestyle accessories worthy of everything he stood for.

There are keepsakes a man collects throughout his lifetime. These heirloom pieces are stashed away for future generations, hidden in a top drawer or forgotten in a glovebox. Ezra Arthur creates artifacts worthy of discovery – from father to son, passed down from one generation to the next.

At the height of the economic downturn, small factories – the lifeblood of the American economy – closed at an alarming rate. Skilled trades and first-rate manufacturing methods were abandoned. Ezra Arthur sought to save this crucial component of American manufacturing, bought up century-old equipment and built our own facility in the heart of Phoenix, Arizona’s waning warehouse district.

By combining modern engineering with century-old practices, we handcraft dependable keepsakes that look as great as they last.","Retail Apparel and Fashion","11-50 employees","Privately Held","Phoenix, Arizona","United States","ezraarthur.com","https://www.linkedin.com/company/ezraarthur"

ABOUT THE DESIGNERS
Growing up in the fashion industry is where designers Valerie and Stephanie first fell in love of fashion and design.

Valerie graduated from the prestigious Parsons School of Design in New York City. While in New York she gained industry experience at Tory Burch, Vanity Fair, and Harpers Bazaar.

Stephanie started her career as a Federal Tax intern and rose to become a Federal Tax Associate with KPMG. Realizing how much she missed creativity and design, she made the choice to return to her first love - fashion.

In 2011 the sisters became the new creative directors of Moonlight and started their namesake collection, Val Stefani.

,"Stereo Sound Agency","Stereo was founded in 1992 when long term friends Jason Lee and Chris Pastras decided the skateboarding world lacked what creatively drove them. The brand turned the skate world on its ears with timeless, classic, and totally original inspirations.

Together, Jason and Chris released two skateboard films: A Visual Sound (’94) and Tincan Folklore (’96). Going against the grain with the use of 8mm film, black and white still photography and avant-garde music, the two films are now revered as classics within the skateboard community. Similarly, the ""retro-modern"" design aesthetic Stereo brought to skate graphics in '92, was worlds away from the cartoony, blood and guts filled design skateboarding was accustomed too.

Now with over 2 decades of heritage, Stereo continues to be an influential skateboard brand. To this day, each and every project and product produced by Stereo remains... Timeless, Classic and Original.","Retail Apparel and Fashion","11-50 employees","Partnership","Los Angeles, California","United States","stereosoundagency.com","https://www.linkedin.com/company/stereo-sound-agency"
