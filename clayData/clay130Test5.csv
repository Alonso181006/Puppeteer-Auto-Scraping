,"ARMEX","✅ ARMEX","ARMEX","ARMEX the Original Baking Soda Abrasive
Sodium Bicarbonate (baking soda) abrasive blasting originated back in the 1980’s during the restoration of the Statue of Liberty. During the planning of the project, Church & Dwight Co., Inc. maker of ARM & HAMMER baking soda was contacted by the engineers looking for a way to remove the final two interior coating layers without damaging Lady Liberty’s delicate copper skin. Through trial and error the engineers tested many different blasting abrasives and discovered that Sodium Bicarbonate had extraordinary cleaning and coating removal properties while not causing any surface damage. Following this success, Church & Dwight Co., Inc. launched the first Sodium Bicarbonate blasting abrasive, ARMEX.  


Not All Sodium Bicarbonates are the Same 
ARMEX formulations are unique and distinct from other Sodium Bicarbonate blasting abrasives. Sodium Bicarbonate comes in different grades of material which affects product quality and consistency. ARMEX formulations are manufactured in a consistent process and controlled environment using the highest grade of Sodium Bicarbonate available. This is what makes ARMEX the most consistent and highest quality Sodium Bicarbonate on the market. ARMEX Sodium Bicarbonate comes in different granule sizes ranging from 70 to 270 microns. The micron size will determine the degree of aggressiveness of cleaning with 270 microns providing the highest/extreme level of cleaning and 70 microns for more light/delicate cleaning. An additional benefit of ARMEX products are flow aids and advance moisture control additives which will prevent vapor blast equipment from clogging. Sodium Bicarbonate is a natural desiccant and loves to absorb water. Without these flow aids and advance moisture control additives, traditional Sodium Bicarbonates would clog vapor blast equipment. In addition it helps to preserve ARMEX when stored in high moisture environments.

Day-Glo Color Corp. is the world's largest manufacturer of daylight fluorescent pigments. We develop technologies that improve and enhance any color, from subtle specialty effects, to glow-in-the-dark pigments, to our classic range of fluorescents.
 
We're proud of our heritage and the role our fluorescents played in pop culture history. From the days of disco to punk rock and pop-art posters to graffiti on the Berlin wall - no matter the trend, no matter the event, Day-Glo was there, making things brighter, bolder, and so much cooler! But there's a lot more to Day-Glo than just fluorescents.

With our extensive technical expertise and diversified product lines, Day-Glo has served the world's color marketplace since the 1930's. At Day-Glo, we make colors better - richer reds, brighter oranges, deeper greens, and even colors that glow in the dark!

Discover for yourself our custom color solutions for packaging and consumer goods, plastics, graphic arts, paints and coatings, dyes and textiles, as well as the personal care and cosmetics ingredients industries.

Day-Glo was founded in 1946 by Bob and Joe Switzer, who originally experimented with certain dyes and resins that produced bright colors that had the unique effect of glowing under ultraviolet light. These unique effects were originally used in magic shows and theater. As the chemistry and manufacturing process improved, the areas of application expanded.

In 1991 Day-Glo was purchased by its current owner, RPM, Inc., a worldwide producer of coatings, sealants and specialty chemicals. Today Day-Glo's technology has continued to grow and the company has developed products for many other industries including security pigments, and consumer products.","Chemical Manufacturing","201-500 employees","Public Company","Cleveland, OH","United States","dayglo.com","https://www.linkedin.com/company/day-glo-color-corp",,,,,
