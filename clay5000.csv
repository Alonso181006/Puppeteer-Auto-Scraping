,"Ensystex Inc.","✅ Ensystex","Ensystex","ENSYSTEX was founded in 1994 by pest control operators intent on changing the landscape of the professional pest control industry. To our knowledge, our effort represents the first time that pest control operators have ever started a chemical company intent on developing and marketing products for the industry.

In the face of a structural pest control industry dominated by a few large chemical companies, we fully understand why it has been difficult for many PCOs to take our small effort seriously, however the registration of our bait product, Labyrinth and our subsequent registration of a multitude of additional pest control products, should serve as a wake-up call to those that doubted the extent of our commitment or our willingness to devote the necessary resources to bringing these products to market.

More than anything else, the development of EXTERRA and the Thor line of products is proof of what devotion to an idea by a small group of individuals working together can accomplish. Our ever-increasing list of pest control professionals is proof that this idea has truly met the needs of our structural pest control industry.","Chemical Manufacturing","51-200 employees","Privately Held","Fayetteville , North Carolina","United States","ensystex.com","https://www.linkedin.com/company/ensystex",,,,,

,"Cortec Water Treatment","✅ Cortec Water Treatment","Cortec Water Treatment","Asset Preservation
Corrosion is a constant threat to the integrity and reliability of every industrial asset such as boiler, closed loop, and evaporative cooling water systems. Proper preservation of these assets during layup is critical to ensuring long service life and smooth operations when bringing the equipment back online. Cortec’s highly effective corrosion solutions help keep your assets in good condition while minimizing downtime and labor costs.

Short-Term/Long-Term Layup
Whether your equipment will be offline for two weeks or two years, Cortec offers outstanding layup strategies for keeping your equipment corrosion-free and making it easy to bring back into operation. Many of Cortec’s products contain Vapor phase Corrosion Inhibitors that offer multi-phase protection—forming a self-replenishing molecular barrier below the surface of the water, in void spaces above water, and at the air-water interface. This allows the flexibility of protection in either dry or wet layup—for the long-term, on standby, and sometimes even during operation.

Safer, Simpler Alternatives
Cortec offers a wide range of corrosion solutions that are much safer and/or simpler to use compared to standard protection methods. With Cortec strategies, you can replace the cumbersome use of desiccants and avoid the hazards associated with nitrogen blanketing and hydrazine. Cortec’s broad range of organic corrosion inhibitors are also generally easier to discharge into municipal wastewater systems than traditional inorganic inhibitors that do not biodegrade. Cortec water chemistry allows you to replace nitrites, molybdates, phosphonates, and phosphates.","Chemical Manufacturing","201-500 employees",,"St Paul, Minnesota","United States","cortecwatertreatment.com","https://www.linkedin.com/company/cortec-water-treatment",,,,,

,"6K","✅ 6K","6K","6K’s UniMelt microwave plasma develops advanced materials across a wide spectrum of markets including metal powders for additive manufacturing and advanced materials for battery storage. It’s positioned to replace today’s traditional processes, which are environmentally unfriendly. 6K overcomes these limitations, delivering a significantly lower cost, more sustainable approach. 

In additive manufacturing, the UniMelt utilizes materials like CNC scrap and turns it into premium powder. With close to 100% yield, energy is saved and waste eliminated throughout the process.  Competing technologies create 70-75% scrap and are forced to either send it to landfill or put it back into the supply chain, increasing energy and carbon waste dramatically.  

It’s a similar story with battery materials. Traditional processes generate large amounts of pollutants, consume huge quantities of water, use energy-intensive processes and take 2-3 days for production. The UniMelt produces material in 1-2 seconds, produces zero hazardous waste, achieves a 6X reduction in water usage, and a 3x reduction in power usage and CO2 emissions.","Chemical Manufacturing","51-200 employees","Privately Held","North Andover, Massachusetts","United States","6kinc.com","https://www.linkedin.com/company/6kinc",,,,,

USA.

Tata Chemicals North America's (TCNA) Green River operation owes its existence to a huge prehistoric lake that existed about 50 million years ago. At that time, its fresh waters covered roughly 40,000 square miles of what is now southwestern Wyoming. This vast inland sea â€” called 
Gosiute Lake by geologists â€” occupied a portion of the Green River basin.

Beginning in the early Eocene geologic period (approximately 35 million years ago) the fresh water lake shrank in size and became saline, expanded and then became fresh water again. As this lake expanded and then contracted, it laid down trona in sedimentary beds up to 37 feet thick and covering nearly 1,000 square miles.

The resulting deposit is a unique and exceptionally pure combination of sodium carbonates, readily convertible to high quality soda ash. It is estimated to contain more than 100 billion tons of mineable trona, enough to meet global soda ash demand for hundreds of years at current levels of consumption.","Chemical Manufacturing","501-1,000 employees","Public Company","Green River, Wyoming","United States","tatachemicals.com","https://www.linkedin.com/company/tata-chemicals-north-america",,,,,

,"Vanderbilt Chemicals, LLC","✅ Vanderbilt Chemicals","Vanderbilt Chemicals","R. T. Vanderbilt Company opened its doors for business on 42nd Street in New York City in 1916. It was started by a 31-year-old named Robert Thurlow Vanderbilt who had $1,000 of his own, a $24,000 family loan, and a contract to sell clay for a company in the South. However, while soft clay was geared to the needs of the paper industry, Continental Clay and North American Clay Company (of which Robert was a director) were also mining hard clays more suitable to the rubber industry. This introduced Vanderbilt to the rubber industry. The rubber industry was in its infancy with the most significant market being tires. R. T. Vanderbilt entered into an agreement to sell rubber chemicals into non-tire markets, and the Vanderbilt Rubber Handbook was created to support “how to” technology in hoses, footwear, wire and cable, and mechanical goods. The Vanderbilt Handbook remains as the most comprehensive reference in rubber compounding today. In 1948, Vanderbilt begin to manufacture chemicals in Bethel, CT to support rubber, plastic, paint and paper additive needs, and in 1955, the birth of the petroleum additives product line emerged. Continued growth created a need for more production capacity and in the 1970’s, a new chemical and mineral processing operation was built in Murray, KY.

In 2013, the R. T. Vanderbilt Company reorganized into 6 new companies and Vanderbilt Chemicals, LLC was founded. This change allowed for better market focus and improvement in business results. Vanderbilt Chemicals LLC is committed to the markets we serve with an extensive portfolio and global reach through Vanderbilt Worldwide Ltd. and Vanderbilt Trading in Beijing.

,"Highland International, LLC","✅ Highland International","Highland International","Highland International represents the future of coatings technology. We began producing specialized coating systems in 1989 when a need was recognized in the Hot Mix Asphalt industry that was not being met. We wanted to provide the very “BEST” high temperature coating systems to fill the voids in this industry. With this goal, we implemented formulation concepts and ideas that not only solved this industry’s coating problems, but tapped into the needs of other industries requiring specific high temperature needs as well. As things fell into place with Highland’s HiTemp Coating Line, other revolutionary ideas were pursued. Highland Dry-Fall “Spray-Safe” Line was born followed by HiTemp Dry-Fall, Chem-Temp, and Aero-Shield Lines -- to name a few, all of which are now being used to solve application and corrosion issues in an array of industrial applications.

In keeping with the company’s founding principles, Highland continues to take a different approach to making paint. Instead of formulating a coating with the hopes of finding a good fit in various industries; Highland researches particular industries to pinpoint specific needs that are not currently being met. The same approach is taken with OEM customers. Highland will evaluate coating requirements and engineer systems that will deliver the precise aesthetics, durability, and production efficiency required for each specific customer.

,"Goex","✅ Goex","Goex","Goex is a proud American business with a rich history.

We manufacture black powder used for sporting applications such as civil war re-enactments and flint lock firearms, and is a vital component for industrial and military applications. It remains as the only U.S. manufacturer of black powder.

GOEX has over a 220 year history of black powder manufacturing in the United States and Goex intends to be a good steward of this company’s history and tradition.

In 1802, E.I. Du Pont de Nemours broke ground on his original black powder plant along the Brandywine River in Delaware. To meet the growing demand for black powder, E.I. Du Pont de Nemours began construction on the Belin Plant in Pennsylvania and produced the first batches of black powder in 1912. The Belin Plant supplied military black powder during World War I, World war II, and the Korean and Vietnam conflicts.

In the early 1970’s, the Belin Plant became a part of Goex. Goex continued to supply black powder for Military and Industry and for a growing Sporting interest. In 1997, Goex moved to Minden, Louisiana to continue the tradition of manufacturing fine quality black powder.

In 2022 Goex was bought by Estes Energetics and became Goex Industries, LLC.","Chemical Manufacturing","11-50 employees","Privately Held","Minden, LA","United States","goexpowder.com","https://www.linkedin.com/company/goex-industries",,,,,

What is hypochlorous acid, the active ingredient in EP500?  
 
Hypochlorous acid (HOCl) is an effective germicidal agent. It is naturally produced by the human body's immune cells as part of our natural defense mechanism against pathogens. It works by penetrating the cell walls of microorganisms and disrupting their vital cellular functions, leading to the inactivation or death of these harmful agents. 

Through advanced technology, we’re now able to create HOCl outside of the human body. It is an effective disinfectant in various settings, including healthcare, food industry, water treatment, and general sanitation. It is less irritating and corrosive than other disinfectants, and generally considered safe and environmentally friendly when used appropriately.","Chemical Manufacturing","11-50 employees","Privately Held","Boca Raton, Florida","United States","earthpowerproducts.com","https://www.linkedin.com/company/earth-power-products",,,,,

,"InfraTrac","✅ InfraTrac","InfraTrac","“The most promising is a technique developed by InfraTrac” (3dprint.com)
Cyber-physical security for 3D printing, packaging, drugs, electronics:  InfraTrac’s chemical fingerprints protect against counterfeiting, with a covert internal taggant mix that can be authenticated instantly, anywhere.  Additive manufacturing is moving from prototyping into manufacturing, starting with defense and aerospace spare parts and medical devices. The rise of 3D scanners makes it possible for anybody to make a copy, authorized or not, and there have not been ways to validate the object itself.  InfraTrac’s patented technology places layers inside the object, managed with secure printer software, to protect both brands and national security.  Validation uses a special light, an off-the-shelf, pocket-sized spectrometer, that provides a simple yes-no answer: genuine or fake.

Beyond 3D:
Wrap: Coded plastic, paperboard, or coated metal lets you protect shrinkwrap, neckbands, blister packs, bottle sleeves, ingredient packaging, or snack packs, verified in an instant, anywhere in the supply chain.

Drugs: Patented in-dose fingerprinting offers the promise of tracking substances, not just packaging. Currently optimized for powders and pills, it is also capable of tracking liquids.  The easiest way to take advantage of in-dose fingerprinting is to change the formulation of inactive ingredients. Tiny changes are detected spectroscopically … so tiny that no new FDA approval is needed, since the alterations fall within the SUPAC level 1 guidelines, for Scale-Up and Post-Approval Changes.  Use coded taggants or in-dose fingerprinting to track thousands of batches, and detect both black market and gray market interlopers.","Chemical Manufacturing","11-50 employees","Privately Held","Silver Spring, MD","United States","infratrac.com","https://www.linkedin.com/company/infratrac",,,,,

It is how we serve our lifetime global customers!

A FAMILY LEGACY
Hi-Tech Plating was established in 1985 by Charles Weindorf, an electrical engineer, and his son, John, a skilled plating technologist. Their vision was to create a successful company to serve the manufacturing industry.
In 1988, the company expanded its hard chrome operations by adding a second facility to support nickel coatings.
Charles retired in 1990, and in 2000, John's daughter, Angela, and son, Marc, joined the team.
Angela and Marc became managers of the business in 2008. Their focus was to provide superior quality in the most cost-effective and efficient manner.
In 2014, Angela and Marc purchased Hi-Tech Plating and envisioned further innovations in manufacturing efficiency without sacrificing the company’s exceptional quality standards. They focused on maintaining a team of specialized, empowered employees working together in a team environment. 
In 2019, Angela and Marc sold Hi-Tech Plating to another Pennsylvania family who was best suited to nurture and grow the customers and team. Angela and Marc were looking for a values match in a buyer, and Harry Zechman was looking for a values match in a seller. Angela, Marc and Harry were pleased with the outcome and the smooth transition.
In 2021, we added a new technology capability — Hi-Performance Films.  These thin films have extremely high hardness, low friction, increased wear resistance and prevent oxidation. Hi-Tech Plating is now able to produce a wide variety of thin films for many applications to help our global customers.

It all began with the invention of EnSolv — an nPB-based solvent that revolutionized the industry. Our line of n-propyl bromide-based, non-ozone depleting industrial cleaning solvents was developed to replace more environmentally hazardous and toxic chemicals (like CFCs, 1,1,1-trichloroethane, trichloroethylene and perchloroethylene) with safer, greener solutions that don’t sacrifice performance.

Enviro Tech has continued to build upon that initial goal with the creation of our NEXT generation fluorinated solvent line — products that, like EnSolv, have a global warming potential of zero, and an even higher human exposure threshold.

OUR MISSION

The following statements sum up Enviro Tech’s goals and philosophy:

- We are the top supplier of stabilized n-propyl bromide and fluorinated solvents for industrial cleaning applications.
Since creating the nPB solvent market in 1994, we’ve sought to be the best and most knowledgeable at what we do in order to best serve our customers.
 - We want nothing more than to keep you and your business operating smoothly and uninterrupted.

By 1998, AFT had more than 8 Dynalene branded products covering a very wide temperature range from -112°C (-170°F) to 350°C (662°F).
 
As the popularity of Dynalene heat transfer fluids grew in a variety of industrial applications, AFT developed several innovative fluids and chemistries to cover as many applications as possible. The Dynalene brand name was well established with over 40 fluids that included several custom fluids made for customers depending on their applications. In 2005, the company changed its name from Advanced Fluid Technologies Inc. to Dynalene Inc. Over the last 5 years, the company has experienced significant growth, and was ranked by Inc. magazine to be among the fastest growing companies for two years.
 
Due to the research and instrumentation capabilities developed in the last decade, Dynalene created two business divisions, Dynalene Laboratory Services and Dynalene Nano Materials. Laboratory Services division helps customers determine several critical properties of their materials or help solve technical problems they are encountering.","Chemical Manufacturing","11-50 employees","Privately Held","Whitehall, PA","United States","dynalene.com","https://www.linkedin.com/company/dynalene",,,,,

Construction on the original 20-million-gallon plant near Oshkosh started in 2002. Under the Utica Energy banner, this plant opened for business in 2003. Almost immediately, customers signaled the need for additional capacity, so by 2004 the plant expanded to create 40 million gallons of ethanol yearly.

Adding a grain dryer in nearby Pickett in 2005 gave the plant the ability to add value to wet meal created by ethanol processing. Including a second grain delivery location, GB Elevator, in Green Bay in 2011 expanded our ability to secure corn needed to maintain a round-the-clock production system.

Ace Ethanol acquired all Utica Energy facilities in 2013, infusing our operation with new dedication for efficiency, capacity, and top-quality products.

Priced an order of magnitude below other SiC fibers in the marketplace, SI-TUFF 7-Series enables the development and commercialization of a new class of high performance, low-cost CMCs and MMCs.

Silar Silicon Carbide Whiskers: ultra high purity single-crystal ""whiskers"" of β-SiC. Used in high performance ceramic cutting tools, wear parts, and industrial tooling and equipment with extreme toughness and abrasion resistance. Composites reinforced with Silar exhibit excellent thermal dissipation and thermal shock resistance.

CERAMTUFF Press-Ready Blends: engineered blends of high-purity, fine grain aluminum oxide and Silar SiC whiskers. Parts made from CERAMTUFF are characterized by exceptional hardness, compressive strength, fracture toughness, wear resistance, thermal shock resistance, and dimensional stability.

A little story about Reagent World:

Around 1991 to 1993, seven friends of Ph.D. chemistry students graduated from New Mexico State University (Las Cruces, NM, USA.) One smart person taught the rest of the group that chemists could do business as well. From that period, these chemists started many companies and today many of them became successful and wealthy. The smartest ones retired already and others still work. In the 2000s, with a budget of $20 million US dollars and contracted forces of 80 chemists and software programmers and after duration of 4 years and several hundred thousands of man hours of hard work, a company was created and named Reagent World.","Chemical Manufacturing","51-200 employees","Privately Held","Ontario, California","United States","reagentworld.com","https://www.linkedin.com/company/reagent-world",,,,,

,"PoloPlaz","✅ PoloPlaz","PoloPlaz","PoloPlaz began in the early 1960s as National Coatings Co. The founder of the company had been employed during the 1950s in research and development at Union Carbide. During this period, Union Carbide spent considerable resources developing the polyurethane technology that had emerged during World War II.

The company prospered as a small business until the founder became ill and could no longer manage the business. In 1988 the company switched ownership, since then the company has grown and become a leader in hardwood floor finishing in North America. Over the years, millions of dollars have been invested into new products, facilities and equipment to keep National Coatings on the cutting edge of finish technology.

PoloPlaz was the trade name of the National Coatings products. As time passed, more and more customers began referring to the company by the brand name, so, in 2006, National Coatings officially became known as PoloPlaz.

Unlike nearly all other finish companies – which purchase all or some of their products from contract or toll manufacturers – PoloPlaz products are all made in-house from proprietary formulations. This approach ensures that PoloPlaz products are designed specifically for the intended application, formulated with the highest quality of ingredients, and maintained to best-in-class standards.

In 2017, PoloPlaz became part of Valentus Specialty Chemicals bringing together innovative floor coatings and other trusted brands used by professionals. Collectively, our history and experiences now span over 121 years with a heritage and superior products that deliver results and provides solutions for every flooring need.","Chemical Manufacturing","51-200 employees","Privately Held","Jacksonville, Arkansas","United States","poloplaz.com","https://www.linkedin.com/company/poloplaz",,,,,

Compressed gases put the fizz in our sodas; keep our party balloons floating; and incandescent lights glowing. They enable deep-sea divers to explore the oceans; and rockets to jettison from earth. Nitrogen keeps foods frozen while in transit and fresh after packaging. Liquid Nitrogen allows us to preserve reproductive cells and store biological samples. Argon creates an atmosphere for growing crystals; preserving fine wines; and acts as a shielding gas during laser operations and arc-welding processes. Helium is used to safeguard our Declaration of Independence; and as a cooling medium for nuclear reactors and MRIs. Helium is used to detect extremely small leaks; and in air to air missiles for guidance corrections. Oxygen is an oxidizer in fuels for propelling rockets, and controls the PH in water treatment plants. Medical oxygen is used to treat emphysema, pneumonia and heart disorders; in Hyperbaric treatments and Wound Care Centers. Carbon Dioxide is used to create dry ice; decaffeinate coffee and special effects in the entertainment industry. CO2 is the propellant for fire extinguishers, paintball guns and pneumatic tools.

We founded Affinity after long careers in the liquid aluminum sulfate industry. Time and again, we saw first-hand where regional markets were under-served, resulting in higher prices or price instability, and gaps in service.

When you work with Affinity Chemical, you’ll discover we serve you from a different dynamic. We’re entrepreneurs who collaborate with our customers and supply chain partners on building regional infrastructure to give you consistent alum product along with exemplary service and transparent, predictable pricing.

Our customers range from Fortune 500 companies to small proprietors and all are treated with the respect and focus they deserve. We start by listening to customer needs, then we analyze the regional alum market, and collaborate with the customer and our supply chain partners to develop a solution that provides price security, high quality product, and dependable service.","Chemical Manufacturing","11-50 employees","Privately Held","Dallas, TX","United States","affinitychemical.com","https://www.linkedin.com/company/affinity-chemical",,,,,

,"Exmere Ltd","✅ Exmere","Exmere","Exmere was formed in 1984 for the specific purpose of developing a new generation of silicas for chromatography.

The first product was the Exsil 300 range aimed at being an alternative to Vydac. 

This was followed by the Exsil 100 range which was targeted at Spherisorb. Although a close match, it was found to be slightly less retentive so a higher surface area product was introduced, Exsil 80. This is actually a 90 A media but so was Spherisorb although it was also marketed as an 80A. The high degree on control of pore size ( +/- 3%) allows us to manufacture two ranges which differ only 10A in pore diameter.

While deactivated phases were being developed, we were also able to introduce two ranges (Avanti and Avanti BDS) aimed at being alternatives to Hypersil and Hypersil BDS.

,"The Dura Wax Company","✅ The Dura Wax","The Dura Wax","It Started Out Of Necessity.
It was 1935, the height of the depression. Elmer “Jack” Wentzel found himself with a problem. Jack had floors to finish and no wax. Big suppliers were cutting back production, limiting supply and driving up prices. With jobs scarce because of the times, Jack wasn’t about to lose work. So, being the industrious guy he was, he bought himself a 50 pound block of carnuba wax, melted it in a boiling soapy solution to make an emulsion and added shellac for a high shine. What Jack created was a water based finish that was a distinct improvement over the harsh solvent based finishes of the day. 

Before long, word spread to other contractors about Jack's finish. He became so busy he outgrew the little garage behind his home and The Dura Wax Company was formed. 

Over the years the product lines increased to include strippers, general purpose, floor and carpet cleaners and a complete line of janitorial equipment from floor mops to floor machines, automatic strippers, vacuums, dispensers, buckets and carts.  

At Dura Wax, we understand your day can entail a variety of cleaning challenges, so we are here to help support you with our products and knowledge to make your job easier.

,"East West Copolymer, LLC.","✅ East West Copolymer","East West Copolymer","East West Copolymer's (formerly Lion Copolymer) SBR/NBR site has been a landmark of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, since the 1940s.  The facility was designed and built by the U.S. Government during World War II, and since then has played a major role in the development and advancement in synthetic rubber technology.

 Operations of the SBR facility began in 1943 with a hot emulsion polymerization process.  Soon after, in 1948, the facility retooled its operations and developed the first cold polymerization plant in North America.  This allowed for better process control and end physical properties of most grades of SBR rubber.  With almost two decades passing, the Baton Rouge facility then designed and modified part of its facility to produce NBR grades of rubber, completing this effort in 1965.

 Since that time, through dedicated employees and further investment, the Baton Rouge site has continued to improve and expand its performance in the synthetic rubber market.  The Baton Rouge Plant is a continuous process facility, operated 24-hours per day, year round, to support and supply our customer's quality rubber needs.

 The facility's 70 year history is a testament to East West Copolymer's commitment and leadership as a synthetic rubber producer.","Chemical Manufacturing","51-200 employees","Privately Held","Baton Rouge, Louisiana","United States","ewcopolymer.com","https://www.linkedin.com/company/east-west-copolymer-llc.",,,,,

This led to the formulation of the Chemical Club of Philadelphia “for the purpose of better friendship and fellowship among the individuals and firms engaged in the chemical business in Philadelphia.” In the original year membership consisted of 23 firms comprising about 40 individuals, paying $5.00 annual dues.

These early beginnings came to full fruition with the undertaking of our current scholarship fund. This began in 1970 with an initial individual grant of $500.00. Our 50/50 fund began in 1975 and enabled our club to greatly expand its contributions. Currently we give six grants of apiece to students at universities throughout the area.

Today, the Club has expanded to a base membership of 184 members representing 139 companies with annual dues of $100 per year.","Chemical Manufacturing","201-500 employees","Privately Held","Philadelphia, PA","United States","chemclubofphiladelphia.org","https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-chemical-club-of-philadelphia",,,,,

Drilling
Oil entrainment in drilling mud can cause poor chemical performance and hinder recycle operations. ProTreat offers additives to help separate oil and break out lubricants, so that recycle operations are successful.
	
Completion
Well completion operations include well stimulations and subsequent plug drill outs/cleanouts to prepare the well for production. SRB and APB contamination is a major concern in these operations. A good biocide program is essential to mitigate bacteria that could cause production impairment during the life of the well through production of corrosive materials such as hydrogen sulfide and carbonic acid, or indirectly through scaling or biomass that restrict well flow capacity. ProTreat provides multiple biocides for treating these problems.
	
Production
The production of hydrocarbons needs to be achieved safely, economically, and in compliance with regulatory agencies. While great improvements have been made in understanding produced fluid characteristics, the solutions to daily production problems remains complex.

,"KulKote","✅ KulKote","KulKote","KulKote is a Temperature Regulating Technology. It's a proprietary coating consisting of water based polymers and Phase Change Materials (PCM). It’s an industrial product that is used in consumer goods. KulKote is typically applied to flexible foams, textiles, and/or fibers for the purpose of regulating body temperature.

Example: Mattresses/Pillows are either all foam or have foam components in them. Foams are prone to absorbing and holding body heat. As a result, the mattress/pillow gets (and stays) hot which makes for an uncomfortable night’s sleep. By regulating the temperature (narrowing the temperature variations), one would enjoy a more restful night of sleep. Better sleep will result in a more fulfilled, productive, and healthier life. For athletes, this will obviously lead to a faster recovery.","Chemical Manufacturing","11-50 employees","Privately Held","Park City, UT","United States","kulkote-inside.com","https://www.linkedin.com/company/kulkote",,,,,

,"EthicalChem","✅ EthicalChem","EthicalChem","Ethical Solutions, LLC is a privately held Shepard Group company and markets its innovative chemical technologies under the EthicalChem brand.
Technology development was initiated in 2005 to address a technically challenging problem in the remediation industry – non aqueous phase liquid (NAPL). Treating this material through conventional chemical oxidation poses both physical and economic difficulties. Physically the ability to oxidize the NAPL it is limited since oxidation takes place in the aqueous phase, and the contamination is in a non-aqueous phase. In cases where there is bulk free phase material the amount of oxidant required to chemically treat a large contaminant mass would not be economical. The use of our plant-based surfactants with environmentally friendly oxidants overcomes this issue by delivering the NAPL to the aqueous phase where it can be easily be destroyed by the aqueous phase oxidants or it can be extracted.
Through years of partnerships with universities, commercial entities, and government agencies including US EPA, University of Connecticut, Texas A&M, and University of Wyoming, our technologies have developed and evolved to be leading edge solutions for the markets we serve. Our surfactant-based solutions have expanded from the environmental industry to the oil production industry. Our plant-based formulas offer high flash-point, low vapor, safer solvents for oil industry applications, and also leadership performance in removing oil based drilling mud during well completion. 
We hold ten issued patents and seven patents pending for our remedial and oil industry technologies and products. We specialize in plant-based, green chemistry and strive to provide our clients with innovative, cost effective, high performance, and environmentally friendly alternatives in both the remediation and oil & gas markets.","Chemical Manufacturing","11-50 employees","Privately Held","South Windsor, Connecticut","United States","ethicalchem.com","https://www.linkedin.com/company/ethicalchem",,,,,

,"Bane-Clene Corp.","✅ Bane-Clene Corp.","Bane-Clene Corp.","On February 4th, 1962, Wm. F. Bane, Jr., started a part-time cleaning venture to subsidize his education. His first account brought in $40.00 a month. Within a few months the entire Bane family was working part-time in the business, and in January of 1965  Bill hired his dad as a full-time employee of the company.

Mother (Elizabeth) and brother (Don) came with the company full-time in 1969 when the transition was made from a janitorial service company to a carpet cleaning operation that specialized in residential cleaning.
Today, Bill, Elizabeth (Betty), Bill, Jr., and Don are the principal shareholders in the Bane-Clene Corporation, which grew from that very humble beginning.

Bane-Clene's rise from obscurity to one of the major forces in the carpet cleaning industry is a true Horatio Alger story in the best American tradition.

Studies have revealed a clear link between toxic cleaning products irritating mucus membranes in the airways, which with repeated long-term exposure resulted in lasting negative changes to the airways themselves as well as asthma, COPD, emphysema and cancer. Toxic cleaning products aren’t just tough on your respiratory function—they kill probiotic organisms (good bacteria) along with the bad bacteria. Some of these ingredients, such as paragons, quaternary ammonium compounds (QUATS), chlorine bleach, Triclosan, and triclocarban, are absorbed through the skin and once inside your body, they may upset your delicate microbial balance. In fact it has been shown that these dangerous ingredients get into breast milk as well as cause birth defects.

Ingredients found in common multipurpose cleaners and disinfectants can irritate eyes, skin, throat and lungs, and interfere with the health and/or function of your red blood cells, kidney, hormones, liver, nervous system, reproductive system, DNA cellular and endocrine system as well as GI discomfort and challenges with equilibrium. These obvious negative health effects an unanticipated impact with repetitive use on employees or clients could become costly to a company; increases sick days, disability claims, and even employee lawsuits.

Chemicals from disinfectants can enter the environment from many different sources such as landfills, incinerators, tanks, drums, or factories. These chemicals can move through air, soil, and water. They can also be on plants or animals, and can get into the air we breathe, the food we eat and the water we drink.

Our offices and primary production facilities are located in Old Bridge New Jersey, just 35 miles south of New York City. Superior Signal specializes in the manufacturing of smoke generating devices and ultrasonic instruments.

In the early 1950's the Superior Signal Company originally designed and manufactured military and ship distress signals for government agencies. While these signals were innovative and effective, they were not suitable for civilian purposes. In 1954, the company developed a safe, non-staining smoke containing no explosive materials for civilian applications.

Superior Smoke Generators have been widely used in many applications, including sewer testing, fire training, leak testing building plumbing, ductwork, boilers and furnaces, tanks, piping, and exhaust systems. Superior Smoke is highly effective for observing air flow patterns, finding sources of odors, evaluating fume/exhaust, and testing smoke control & alarm systems. Other applications include military and law enforcement, special effects, motion pictures and photography, and a variety of hobby applications.

In 1991 Superior Signal introduced the AccuTrak line of Ultrasonic Leak Detectors. These innovative products were developed for plant maintenance applications including compressed gas leaks, vacuum leaks, detection of bearing wear and internal leaks through valves or steam traps as well as HVAC applications. Superior AccuTrak quickly became a leading brand in the ultrasonic leak detector market. 

Superior Signal Company LLC continues to expand our business by offering outstanding service and support to our existing markets, developing innovative new and improved products, and creating new applications and markets for our expanding line of products.

We specialize in both the corrugated and converting industries and feature a wide array of products that differ significantly from conventional product lines. 

Our core product, the FlexaMix, is a complete rethinking of conventional high shear mixers, providing significant monthly savings.  

Specifically, the FlexaMix is the only starch mixing system available, that through the redesign of the mixing tank, together with an exclusive Viscometer, is able to control the swelling of unmodified pearl starch.  These two components have allowed for the best characteristics of the “Stein-Hall” and “No-Carrier” processes to be combined.
 
This ability to precisely control starch swelling achieves the following:
 
- Elimination of the use of starch additives 
- Reduction in starch consumption (to 1.6 LB MSF on average)
- Pre-set and consistent batch-to-batch viscosity 
- Use of untreated corrugator and flexo wash water in starch adhesive production
- Formulation of perfect adhesive for any type of paper
- Lower cook, storage and gel temperatures  
 
The payback period on this unit is on average approximately 8-12 months.

BASE ONE has been tested for years in some of the harshest conditions right here in the Upper Midwest. The frequent temperature extremes and freeze/thaw cycles we experience in this area of the country have provided the ultimate testing conditions for our products.
Our cost effective product will stabilize and enhance aggregate base material as well as full depth reclamation (FDR) projects that utilize a blend of existing asphalt and aggregate base that creates a strong base for the upper surface layer.  Base One also works in Chip Seal Applications, gravel and paved surface stabilization and new road construction.  Our product is consistently proven in independent testing to provide greater average layer coefficient per inch, average resilient modulus (ksi)/stabilized layer, average GE per inch and average tonnage when compared against untreated roadway. 
Team Laboratory Chemical Corporation was founded on the desire to help you build a better road from the bottom up. We hope you’ll consider using BASE ONE for your next road construction project!","Chemical Manufacturing","11-50 employees","Privately Held","Detroit Lakes, Minnesota","United States","teamlab.net","https://www.linkedin.com/company/team-laboratory-chemical-corp",,,,,

Hatle, is one of NACE International's first Certified Coating Inspectors, #207, and since 1985 has studied coatings, application procedures, design, and corrosion management. In 1991 Mr. Hatle identified a previously overlooked and preeminent cause of corrosion and since then he has continued his investigation and made many revolutionary discoveries.

Motivated by his discovery, Mr. Hatle began research on an entirely new method of metal decontamination designed to address the chronic problem of premature coating failure. That research has resulted in the creation of a surprisingly simple and amazingly effective product. CleanWirx 207 revolutionizes metal surface preparation and protection processes, with special benefits for industries where corrosion is extremely difficult to manage.

Corrosion Exchange is proud of its role: assisting organizations in streamlining processes and reducing operating and ownership costs by eliminating the most common cause of coating failure, while optimizing coating adhesion and reliability, and lowering required maintenance frequency and scope.

In addition to making patent-pending CleanWirx 207 available for distribution, Corrosion Exchange will continue research to identify contaminants and other interference impurities, develop environmentally safe, effective and economical solutions, and will assist leading organizations around the world in their pursuit of best practices to ensure the integrity and longevity of all metal surfaces.","Chemical Manufacturing","11-50 employees","Partnership","Houston, Texas","United States","buycleanwirx.com","https://www.linkedin.com/company/cleanwirx207",,,,,

October 1, 2000 was when A B Pest Control was born. Alongside his wife Lisa, they built the company off of the characteristics they liked most about other companies that they used in the service industry. The personalization, friendly environment, and quality and of what was being offered at A B Pest quickly gained the respect of multiple clients throughout the Lake Ozark, MO area. 

The success that has come in the years following is what Bert & Lisa pride themselves of. The image that A B Pest has established and maintained is exactly what they envisioned years ago, just maybe not at the magnitude of what the company is operating at today.

Since the cutting of the grand opening ribbon, multiple divisions of service have been added. Offered alongside pest control are a full variety of lawn care/weed control, nuisance animal trapping and repairs, bed bug/termite/yard treatments, and the most recently added insulation services.

Over the past fifteen years microwave chemistry has made a profound change in the way drugs are discovered. Pharmaceutical companies have used microwave-assisted organic synthesis (MAOS) to develop large compound libraries and cut development time by as much as 90%. Today, every major pharma company uses microwave chemistry as a front-line discovery tool. 
Globally, chemists are realizing the benefits of microwaves as a heat source, and lab-scale microwave reactors are finding their way into all areas of the chemical world. An almost limitless number of studies in the open scientific literature detail microwave’s superior performance relative to conventional heat sources.
By delivering a low cost commercial scale-up route, FCG’s technology has removed the largest hurdle for you to adopt microwave synthesis and take your manufacturing line to the next level.

,"NONTOXIC CERTIFIED","✅ NONTOXIC CERTIFIED","NONTOXIC CERTIFIED","Nontoxic Certified (NTC) programs provide a way to ensure that companies are on a path to making better products based on rigorous, defensible scientific determinations. Given there is no universally-recognized standard for better, safer, cleaner, or sustainable product formulation and manufacturing practices, we offer programs to guide companies through the maze of options delivering ingredient intelligence and improvement potential in a realistic, measured, scientific way. Every program supports safer and more sustainable products for a future where all beings can all thrive.

We help companies craft and improve products for a more sustainable future working in a circular economy ensuring that products deliver against ESG or CSR goals and metrics.

Through measurable, scientific data-driven insights, our team is able to partner with companies to develop a formulation (or reformulation)  roadmap. Tactical steps are deployed in accordance with a company’s mission and strategy. 

To do this work, NTC uniquely deploys the Ecosystem Approach considering all sources of pollution including air, water, soil, sediment, aquatic life and terrestrial life. Additionally, it reviews chemistry classes, supply chain practices, and renewable sourcing practices. This evaluation process for all inputs is what provides true ingredient insights so that companies may understand the implications of ingredient selections prior to use and/or when making changes in existing products. 

By conducting this kind of evaluation, we flip the current chemicals first, consequences second practice existing in the US today. We put the power of ingredient selection back in the hands of companies. Truly sustainable companies are making this kind of ingredient commitment part of their sustainability efforts. 

We work with companies at every phase and stage to provide a roadmap for making more sustainable and closed-loop ingredient choices with tools to benchmark, share progress, and accountability.","Chemical Manufacturing","11-50 employees","Non Profit","Irvington, New York","United States","nontoxiccertified.org","https://www.linkedin.com/company/nontoxic-certified",,,,,

,"Plastic 2 Green Inc.","✅ Plastic 2 Green","Plastic 2 Green","Plastic 2 Green is a seed-stage company currently building a proof-of-concept mobile lab to showcase a method we developed to convert dirty, unsorted, unrecyclable plastics of all varieties into high-value, ""double green"" (Emerald) ammonia and varying grades of carbon black. We are well on our way to reaching our pre-seed fundraising goal of $1 million and appear poised to oversubscribe the round before kicking off our seed round.

We are a team of over a dozen energized volunteers, as most of us are not paid and will not take payment from the company until we complete our seed round. We are a lean and mission-driven crew determined to spur the hydrogen fuels economy of the future by building plants capable of generating truly upcycled, green ammonia from plastic pollution.

Ammonia carries hydrogen with far greater efficiency than hydrogen gas: ammonia is far less flammable; its safety protocols and distribution networks make for cost effective transportation. Industry appears aligned with this vision as leading automotive and shipbuilding companies have commitmented to build ammonia-burning engines to move humanity and commerce using clean fuels by the end of this decade. 

All carbon gases are captured and sequestered in our process by conversion to carbon black. Since our carbon black comes from reforming a waste product, it qualifies as ""recycled."" High-quality, recycled carbon black will command a premium in the production of nanotubes and graphene, while lower grades of carbon black are already desired by tire manufacturers.

By taking readily available processes and adding our own trade secrets and intellectual property to integrate these processes, Plastic 2 Green promises to rapidly address the global plastic pollution scourge on a global scale, with each of our full-capacity plants capable of ingesting 600 tons of plastic pollution a day. It's a highly profitable endeavor, as we estimate that just three such plants will generate over $1 billion annually.","Chemical Raw Materials Manufacturing","11-50 employees","Privately Held","Loveland, CO","United States","plastic2green.com","https://www.linkedin.com/company/plastic2green",,,,,

Corporate History:

Applied Technologies, Inc. came about from the 1988 reorganization of the fortune 500 company ""AMETEK, Inc."". The new down-sized AMETEK then closed down the ""Applied Materials"" division which had functioned as a corporate Research and Development center for the various divisions. Key managerial and technical personnel then purchased part of the assets of the division and formed ""Applied Technologies, Inc."". The company has since used its vast technical resources to develop a full line of specialty materials, inks, and coatings which it now manufactures for use in the electronic component industry. Products include precious metal electrode inks, EMI shielding paints, protective coatings, specialty marking inks, and conductive epoxies, coatings, and lubricants. Our heavily experienced technical staff of chemists and engineers can assist you in selecting a material to best meet your particular requirements.

,"Leather Only, Inc.","✅ Leather Only","Leather Only","Cleans, Conditions, and Protects in One Easy Step.
Cleaning leather can be confusing. Just look on the web and you can find as many different ways to clean leather as there are web sites about leather. Everyone has an opinion about how you should clean leather and then claim that their way is the best way. Some want you to vacuum your leather, others want you to steam clean it. Some say you have to use oil, and others say waxing your leather is the only way. 

Leather Only has been cleaning conditioning & protecting fine leather for over 20 years. It was developed to meet our customers needs and to keep the cleaning process simple, simple, simple. Many products require 2 and 3 steps, buckets, sponges, and time between steps; Then you have to wait a little longer before you can use your leather.

Leather Only will clean leather, condition leather and protect leather in minutes; All in one easy step. You can use your leather immediately,

For 25 years we have been working in customers homes repairing and cleaning leather furniture. Nine times out of ten our customer would ask us,” What do I use for cleaning leather furniture? What kind of leather treatment should I use on my car leather?” Twenty five years ago we couldn’t answer their questions.
Our quest took us to the Department of Agriculture and to The Smithsonian Institute to discover what makes a great leather cleaner, conditioner and protector. THE REST IS HISTORY!

Leather Only was born out of our customers need for a product that would make cleaning leather simple. Since Leather Only began we have been growing and improving our product at every opportunity. We believe Leather Only is the best one step leather care product on the market today. Here at Leather Only, cleaning leather is what we do.

Leather Only is the ONLY leather cleaner you will ever need!

 We understand leather and I would like to thank you for taking the time to visit with us.

,"US Static","✅ US Static","US Static","Our Commitment is to deliver exceptional floor coatings with the Surface Electrical Resistivity you need.  Long lasting and consistent performance is the hallmark of our coatings.

Color Selection is nearly unlimited. We are returning power to the designer.  No longer is the choice between gray or light gray.  US Static can formulate any color on-demand. We designed our systems and paints to be compatible with all the major color charts.  Let your creativity flow.

We begin with a durable floor coating that has a proven track record.  Antistatic properties are only as good as the coating that carries them.  Not all coatings are made the same just as not all customers need the same level of durability.

Static 240 Heavy Duty handles high foot traffic areas.  It began life as a floor coating that could handle the type of repeat foot traffic you see in hallways, at workstations or when a few thousand feet head to lunch.   It has excellent adhesion to bare concrete and previously painted surfaces.   Static 240 is a proven formulation that has the durability required to handle years of traffic and cleanings.

 Static 520 Epoxy has the thickness and hardness to handle hot tire vehicles and forklifts along with all the foot traffic you can throw at it.  It is a two-part epoxy but in a new, innovative water based formulation. It has none of the high VOCs found in traditional epoxy coatings.  Static 520 can be applied direct to bare concrete and to previously painted surfaces.

Antistatic properties are incorporated into our floor coatings.  US Static has purposely designed its products first as exceptional floor coatings.  Our antistatic properties are disbursed throughout our coatings.  This dispersion enables the antistatic properties to last the life of the coating.  

Our commitment extends beyond our products to encompass the technical support professionals demand.  We are available by phone and email to answer your questions.","Chemical Manufacturing","11-50 employees","Privately Held","Newtown, PA","United States","usstatic.com","https://www.linkedin.com/company/us-static",,,,,

,"Lighter Coating","✅ Lighter Coating","Lighter Coating","SilverCon – a universal metal coating combining versatility, performance, and environmental sustainability, resulting in a superior Value Proposition. 

SilverCon is family of nanotechnology compounds based on elemental metallic nanoparticles. Most popular are SilverCon paints with nanoparticles in one of several proprietary solvents (non-toxic water- or organic based solvents) that, after deposition, are evaporated using an infrared laser process or thermally, whereas the laser-based application is compatible with substrates with virtually any melting point. After curing, the achievable surface roughness is only limited by the deposition method of the original paint – we are happy to assist with feasibility studies to support your application using our state-of-the-art material science lab. 

SilverCon’s formulation can be customized to cover virtually any substrate, including ceramics, polymers, glass, as well as any rigid or flexible PCB material or metallic surface. SilverCon’s nanoparticles with adjustable size distributions enable successful coating of even the most “challenging” and low-melt-point materials with a conductivity that reaches bulk copper without resorting to toxic chemicals. Off-the-shelf product is available for the following substrates:

- Polyimide (“Kapton”)
- PTFE (“Teflon”)
- Polyester (e.g., PET, PEN)
- Acrylic (“Plexiglas”)
- FR4 (standard PCB substrate)
- Aluminum
- Copper
- Ceramics
- Other Substrates: On Request

Ordering with us is easy! No archaic “customer onboarding” and payment procedures required. For most standard use cases, small-volume orders include transparent pricing and easy credit card payment options available through our website: https://lightercoating.com. Beyond, we will customize SilverCon to your use case and to your preferred payment methods or -terms up to NET-90. For larger orders, we are in a position to offer custom pricing with long-term delivery contract options.","Chemical Manufacturing","11-50 employees","Privately Held","Lafayette, IN","United States","lightercoating.com","https://www.linkedin.com/company/lighter-coating",,,,,

When You Want a Better Product that Doesn’t Exist… You Have to Make it Yourself

Our lineup of proprietary stone, tile and concrete sealers was developed by our Sister Company in Texas that has specialized in providing stone care maintenance, cleaning, and sealing services for nearly a decade. After becoming frustrated with some of the most popular brands of sealants that were “the best”, our team developed the recipe for our first sealant: TSSPRO 100, a multi-purpose stone, tile and concrete sealer. The rest, as they say, is history.
Developed by Industry Professionals for Homeowners & Contractors Alike

The difference between TSSPRO and other big brand sealants is that ours were developed using formulas that we know work, offering protection for years. We’ve painstakingly scraped and chemically removed more poor quality acrylic sealants than we’d like to remember — which is why we started making our own brand in the first place. It just made good business sense for the service part of our business too; how could we offer a warranty for sealing services using a product we know wouldn’t last?","Chemical Manufacturing","51-200 employees","Partnership","Houston, Texas","United States","tssprosealants.com","https://www.linkedin.com/company/tsspro-sealants",,,,,

,"Garden Maker","✅ Garden Maker","Garden Maker","Natural and organic fertilizers with complete ingredient transparency, custom-mixed for your garden’s unique needs.

At Garden Maker Naturals, we believe you have the fundamental right to know, and control, every ingredient you are feeding your plants and your soil. After all, you can’t truly know what you grow until you know what’s in your fertilizer. We operate our company and build our products with three core values: Total Transparency, Complete Control and Natural Nutrition.

Total Transparency

We call our formulation philosophy Full Plantsparency. We show you the exact formulas for all our Signature Blends; every ingredient, every proportion. Sure, someone else could come along and copy our formula, but so what? For us, it’s not about offering product formulas that no one else has, it’s about offering a level of transparency that no one else provides.

To us, transparency also means minimal messing around with Mother Nature, and making sure every fertilizer ingredient delivers real, garden-growing benefits. In our Signature Blends, every single ingredient serves a nutrient-boosting or microbe-feeding purpose. And our Custom Mixes allow you to eliminate any ingredients your garden might not need.

Complete Control
We know there’s a lot about gardening we can’t control (the weather comes to mind). So it’s important to us to help you control the things you can, like the composition of your fertilizer. Our Mix Customizer lets you choose from a long list of individual ingredients in any combination or proportion, so your fertilizer is 100% tailored to your garden’s unique needs.

We also want to make it easier for you to garden according to your own principles. If you are following strict OMRI guidelines to grow or sell your produce organically, rest assured that every ingredient labeled “Organic” on our site has been approved by OMRI and/or CDFA. Our Vegan products do not contain any animal products, and non-GMO ingredients.","Chemical Manufacturing","51-200 employees","Privately Held","Elwood, Kansas","United States","gardenmaker.com","https://www.linkedin.com/company/gardenmaker",,,,,

,"Attic Pablo Insulation Services","✅ Attic Pablo Insulation Services","Attic Pablo Insulation Services","What happens if you have poor insulation?
Attic insulation prevents the outside temperature from entering your house and keeping the inside temperature constant. This waves off the load on your heating device, and they do not have to work vigorously. However, if this insulation is ripped or damaged, you might notice that your energy bills are suddenly going up.
Insulation Companies in Oakland, CA, use two types of attic materials:
• Fiberglass
• Cellulose
